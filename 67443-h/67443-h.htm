<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> scenery at Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, is perhaps
the most picturesque in America. The view given
in the accompanying engraving is taken from the
Blue Ridge, from whence the tourist enjoys the finest
prospect of this delightful spot. Lofty as the summit
is, and difficult as the ascent proves to the uninitiated,
the magnificence of the view from the top of the
ridge amply compensates the adventurer for his
trouble. Immediately beneath your feet are seen
the Potomac and Shenandoah enveloping the beautiful
village of Harper’s Ferry in their folds, and then
joining, their waters flow on in silent beauty, until
lost behind the gorges of the mountains. Far away
in the distance stretch a succession of woody plains,
diversified with farm-houses and villages, and gradually
growing more and more indistinct, until they
fade away into the summits of the Alleghanies. But
we cannot do better than give President Jefferson’s
unrivalled description of this scene. “The passage,”
he says, “of the Potomac, through the Blue Ridge,
is, perhaps, one of the most stupendous scenes in
nature. You stand on a very high point of land; on
your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged
along the foot of the mountains a hundred miles to
seek a vent, on your left approaches the Potomac,
in quest of a passage also: in the moment of their
junction, they rush together against the mountain,
rend it asunder and pass off to the sea. The first
glance of this scene harries our senses into the
opinion that the mountains were formed first, that the
rivers began to flow afterwards, that, in this place
particularly they have been dammed up by the Blue
Ridge of mountains, and have formed an ocean
which filled the whole valley,—that continuing to
rise, they have at length broken over at this spot,
and have torn the mountain down from its summit to
its base. The piles of rock on each hand, but particularly
on the Shenandoah—the evident marks of
their disrupture and avulsion from their beds by the
most powerful agents of nature, corroborate the impression.
But the distant finishing which nature has
given to the picture, is of a very different character;
it is a true contrast to the foreground; it is as placid
and delightful as that is wild and tremendous,—for
the mountain being cloven asunder, she presents to
your eye, through the cleft, a small closet of smooth
blue horizon, at an infinite distance in the plain
country, inviting you, as it were, from the riot and
tumult roaring around, to pass through the breach
and participate in the calm below. Here the eye
ultimately composes itself, and that way, too, the road
happens actually to lead. You cross the Potomac
just above its junction, pass along its side through
the base of the mountain for three miles, its terrible
precipices hanging over you, and, within about twenty
miles, reach Fredericktown and the fine country
round that. This scene is worth a voyage across the
Atlantic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enthusiastic as Jefferson is in this description, he
does not exceed the truth. Foreigners have borne
ample testimony to the splendor of the prospect from
the top of the ridge at Harper’s Ferry, admitting that
there are few scenes in Europe which surpass it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is time to do justice to American scenery. Hundreds
of our citizens annually cross the Atlantic for
the purpose of visiting the scenery of Europe, under
the mistaken supposition that their own country
affords nothing to compensate them for the trouble of
a visit. This ignorance is less general than formerly,
but it still prevails to a considerable extent. Yet no
country affords finer or more magnificent scenery
than America. Go up the Hudson, travel along the
banks of the Susquehanna, cross the Alleghanies or
ascend the Catskill, loiter over the fairy-like waters
of lake Horicon, and you will cease to believe that
America affords no scenery to reward the traveller.
We say nothing of Niagara or Trenton falls, or of
the mountain scenery scattered all over the south.
We say nothing of the vast prairies of the west,
of the boundless melancholy expanse of the Mississippi,
of the magnificent scenery on the route to St.
Anthony’s Falls. Let our people visit these before
going abroad. Let them learn to do justice to the
country of their birth.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE ESCAPE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> night after the rescue of the passengers and
crew of the brig was to me a restless one. I could
not sleep. Hour after hour I lay in my hammock
eagerly courting repose, but unable to find it, for the
images of the past crowded on my brain, and kept
me in a feverish excitement that drove slumber from
my pillow. My thoughts were of my boyhood,—of
Pomfret Hall,—of my early schoolmate—and of his
little seraph-like sister, Annette. I was back once
more in the sunny past. Friends whom I had long
forgotten,—scenes which had become strangers to
me,—faces which I once knew but which had faded
from my memory, came thronging back upon me, as
if by some magic impulse, until I seemed to be once
more shouting by the brookside, galloping over the
hills, or singing at the side of sweet little Annette at
Pomfret Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was the son of a decayed family. My parents
lived in honorable poverty. But, though reduced in
fortune, they had lost none of the spirit of their ancestors.
Their ambition was to see their son a gentleman,
a man of education. I had accordingly been
early put to school, preparatory to a college education.
Here I met with a youth of my own age, a
proud, high-spirited, generous boy, Stanhope St. Clair.
He was the heir of a wealthy and ancient family,
whose residence, not far from Boston, combined baronial
splendor with classic taste. We formed a fast
friendship. He was a year or two my senior, and
being stronger than myself, became my protector in
our various school frays; this united me to him by
the tie of gratitude. During the vacation I spent a
month at his house; here I met his little sister, a
sweet-tempered innocent fairy, some four or five years
my junior. Even at that early age I experienced
emotions towards her which I am even now wholly
unable to analyze, but they came nearer the sentiment
of love than any other feeling. She was so beautiful
and sweet-tempered, so innocent and frank, so bright,
and sunny, and smiling, so infinitely superior to those
of her age and sex I had been in the habit of associating
with, that I soon learned to look on her with
sentiments approaching to adoration. Yet I felt no
reserve in her society. Her frankness made me perfectly
at home. We played, sung and laughed together,
as if life had nothing for us but sunshine and
joy. How often did those old woods, the quaintly
carved hall, the green and smiling lawn ring with
our gladsome merriment. We studied, too, together;
and as I sat playfully at her feet, looking now on her
book and now in her eyes, while her long silken
tresses undulated in the breeze and frolicked over
my face, I experienced sensations of strange pleasure
unlike anything I had ever experienced. At
length the time came when I was to leave this Eden.
I remember how desolate I felt on that day, but how
from pride in my sex I struggled to hide my emotions.
Annette made no attempt to conceal her sorrow.
She flung herself into my arms and wept long
and bitterly. It was the grief of a child, but it filled
my heart with sunshine, and dwelt in my memory
for years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I returned to school, but my playmate was always
in my thoughts. In dream or awake, at my tasks or
in play, loitering under the forest trees or wandering
by the stream, in the noisy tumult of day or musing in
the silent moonshine, the vision of that light-hearted
and beauteous girl was ever present to my imagination.
It may seem strange that such emotions should
occupy the mind of a mere boy; but so it was. At
length, however, St. Clair took sick, and died. How
bitter was my grief at this event. It was the first
thing that taught me what real sorrow was. This
occurrence broke up my intimacy with the St. Clair
family, for, young as I was, I could perceive that my
presence would be a pain to the family, by continually
reminding them of their lost boy. I never therefore
visited Pomfret Hall again,—but often would I linger
in its vicinity hoping to catch a glance of Annette.
But I was unsuccessful. I never saw her again.
Our spheres of life were immeasurably separated, the
circles in which she moved knew me not. We had
no friends in common, and therefore no medium of
communication. God knew whether she thought of
me. Her parents, though kind, had always acted
towards me as if an impassable barrier existed betwixt
the haughty St. Clairs and the beggared Cavendish,
and now that their son was no more they doubtless
had forgotten me. Such thoughts filled my mind
as I grew up. The busy avocations of life interfered,
my father died and left me pennyless, and, to ensure
a subsistence for my mother and myself, I went to
sea. The dreams of my youth had long since given
way to the sad realities of life,—and of all the sunny
memories of childhood but one remained. That
memory was of Annette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a common saying that the love of a man is but
an episode, while that of a woman is the whole story
of life, nor is it my purpose to gainsay the remark.
The wear and tear of toil, the stern conflict with the
world, the ever changing excitements which occupy
him,—war, craft, ambition,—these are sufficient reasons
why love can never become the sole passion of
the stronger sex. But, though the saying is in general
true, it has one exception. The first love of a
man is never forgotten. It is through weal and woe
the bright spot in his heart. Old men, whose bosoms
have been seared by seventy years conflict with the
world, have been known to weep at the recollection
of their early love. The tone of a voice, the beam
of an eye,—a look, a smile, a footstep may bring up
to the mind the memory of her whom we worshipped
in youth, and, like the rod of Moses, sunder the flinty
rock, bring tears gushing from the long silent fountains
of the heart. Nor has any after passion the
purity of our first love. If there is anything that links
us to the angels, it is the affection of our youth. It
purifies and exalts the heart—it fills the soul with
visions of the bright and beautiful—it makes us scorn
littleness, and aspire after noble deeds. Point me
out one who thus loves, and I will point you out one
who is incapable of a mean action. Such was the
effect which my sentiments for Annette had upon me.
I saw her not, it is true,—but she was ever present to
my fancy. I pictured continually to myself the approbation
she would bestow on my conduct, and I
shrunk even from entertaining an ignoble thought.
I knew that in all probability we should never meet,
but I thirsted to acquire renown, to do some act
which might reach her ears. I loved without hope,
but not the less fervently. A beggar might love a
Princess, as a Paladin of old looked up to his mistress,
as an Indian worshipper adored the sun,
I loved, looked up to, and adored Annette. What
little of fame I had won was through her instrumentality.
And now I had met her, had been her preserver.
As I lay in my hammock the memory of
these things came rushing through my mind, and
emotions of bewilderment, joy, and gratitude, prevented
me from sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had seen Annette only for a moment, as the fatigue
they had endured, had confined herself and
companion to the cabin, during the day. How should
we meet on the morrow? My heart thrilled at
the recollection of her delighted recognition—would
she greet me with the same joy when we met
again? How would her father receive me? A
thousand such thoughts rushed through my brain,
and kept me long awake—and when at length I fell
into a troubled sleep, it was to dream of Annette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I awoke, the morning watch was being
called, and springing from my hammock I was soon
at my post on deck. The sky was clear, the waves
had gone down, and a gentle breeze was singing
through the rigging. To have gazed around on the
almost unruffled sea one would never have imagined
the fury with which it had raged scarcely forty-eight
hours before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in the day Mr. St. Clair appeared on deck,
and his first words were to renew his thanks to me
of the day before. He alluded delicately to past
times, and reproved me gently for having suffered the
intimacy betwixt me and his family to decline. He
concluded by hoping that, in future, our friendship—for
such he called it—would suffer no diminution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was attending, after breakfast, to the execution
of an order forwards, when, on turning my eyes aft, I
saw the flutter of a woman’s dress. My heart told
me it was that of Annette, and, at the instant, she
turned around. Our eyes met. Her smile of recognition
was even sweeter than that of the day before. I
bowed, but could not leave my duty, else I should
have flown to her side. It is strange what emotions
her smile awakened in my bosom. I could scarcely
attend to the execution of my orders, so wildly did
my brain whirl with feelings of extatic joy. At
length my duty was performed. But then a new
emotion seized me. I wished and yet I feared to
join Annette. But I mustered courage to go aft, and
no sooner had I reached the quarterdeck, than Mr.
St. Clair beckoned me to his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annette,” he said, “has scarcely yet given you
her thanks. She has not forgotten you, indeed she
was the first to recognise you yesterday. You remember,
love, don’t you?” he said, turning to his
daughter, “the summer Mr. Cavendish spent with
us at the Hall. It was you, I believe, who shed so
many tears at his departure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said this gayly, but it called the color into his
daughter’s cheek. Perhaps he noticed this, for he
instantly resumed in a different tone:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But see, Annette, here comes the captain, and I
suppose you would take a turn on the quarterdeck.
Your cousin will accompany him,—Mr. Cavendish
must be your <span class='it'>chaperon</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The demeanor of Mr. St. Clair perplexed me.
Could it be that he saw my love for his daughter and
was willing to countenance my suit? The idea was
preposterous, as a moment’s reflection satisfied me. I
knew too well his haughty notions of the importance
of his family. My common sense taught me that he
never had entertained the idea of my aspiring to his
daughter’s hand—that he would look on such a thing
as madness—and his conduct was dictated merely by
a desire to show his gratitude and that of his daughter
to me. These thoughts passed through my mind
while he was speaking, and when he closed, and I
offered to escort his daughter, I almost drew a sigh
at the immeasurable distance which separated me
from Annette. Prudence would have dictated that
I should avoid the society of one whom I was beginning
to love so unreservedly, but who was above my
reach. Yet who has ever flown from the side of the
one he adores, however hopeless his suit, provided
she did not herself repel him? Besides, I could not,
without rudeness, decline the office which Mr. St.
Clair thrust upon me. I obeyed his task, but I felt
that my heart beat faster when Annette’s taper finger
was laid on my arm. How shall I describe the
sweetness and modesty with which Annette thanked
me for the service which I had been enabled to do her
father and herself—how to picture the delicacy with
which she alluded to our childhood, recalling the
bright hours we had spent together by the little
brook, under the old trees, or in the rich wainscoted
apartments of Pomfret Hall! My heart fluttered as
she called up these memories of the past. I dwelt
in return on the pleasure I had experienced in that
short visit, until her eye kindled and her cheek
crimsoned at my enthusiasm. She looked down on
the deck, and it was not till I passed to another theme
that she raised her eyes again. Yet she did not seem
to have been displeased at what I had said. On the
contrary it appeared to be her delight to dwell with
innocent frankness on the pleasure she had experienced
in that short visit. The pleasure of that half
hour’s promenade yet lives green and fresh in my
memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were still conversing when my attention was
called away by the cry of the look-out that a sail was
to be seen to windward. Instantly every eye was
turned over the weather-beam, for she was the first
sail that had been reported since the gale. An officer
seized a glass, and, hurrying to the mast-head, reported
that the stranger was considered a heavy craft,
although, as yet, nothing but his royals could be
seen. As we were beating up to windward and the
stranger was coming free towards us, the distance
betwixt the two vessels rapidly decreased, so that in
a short time the upper sails of the stranger could be
distinctly seen from the deck. His topgallant-yards
were now plainly visible from the cross-trees, and
the officer aloft reported that the stranger was either
a heavy merchantman or a frigate. This increased
the excitement on deck, for we knew that there were
no vessels of that grade in our navy, and if the approaching
sail should prove to be a man-of-war and
an Englishman, our chances of escape would be
light, as he had the weather-gauge of us, and appeared,
from the velocity with which he approached us, to be
a fast sailer. The officers crowded on the quarterdeck,
the crew thronged every favorable point for a
look-out, and the ladies, gathering around Mr. St.
Clair and myself, gazed out as eagerly as ourselves
in the direction of the stranger. At length her top-sails
began to lift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” said the captain, “he has an enormous
swing—what think you of him, Mr. Massey?” he
asked, shutting the glass violently, and handing it to
his lieutenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer addressed took the telescope and gazed
for a minute on the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that craft,” he said energetically, “she
is a heavy frigate,—the Ajax,—I served in her some
eight years since. I know her by the peculiar lift of
her top-sails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said the captain; “you are sure,” he continued,
examining her through his glass again; “she
does indeed seem a heavy craft and we have but one
chance—we should surely fight her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you ask me,” said the lieutenant, “I say no!—why
that craft can blow us out of the water in a
couple of broadsides; she throws a weight of metal
treble our own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there is but one thing to do—we must
wear, and take to our heels—a stern chase is proverbially
a long one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this conversation not a word had been
spoken in our group; but I had noticed that when
the lieutenant revealed the strength of the foe, the
cheek of Annette for a moment grew pale. Her
emotion however continued but a moment. And
when our ship had been wore, and we were careering
before the wind, her demeanor betrayed none of
that nervousness which characterized her cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can they overtake us Mr. Cavendish?” said her
companion. “Oh! what a treacherous thing the sea
is. Here we were returning only from Charleston
to Boston, yet shipwrecked and almost lost,—and
now pursued by an enemy and perhaps destined to
be captured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear not! sweet coz,” laughingly said Annette,
“Mr. Cavendish would scarcely admit that any ship
afloat could outsail <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE ARROW</span>, and you see what a
start we have in the race. Besides, you heard Captain
Smythe just now say, that, when night came, he
hoped to be able to drop the enemy altogether. Are
they pursuing us yet Mr. Cavendish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! yes, they have been throwing out their
light sails for the last quarter of an hour—see there
go some more of their kites.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But will not we also spread more canvass?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was saved the necessity of a reply by an order
from the officer of the deck to spread our studding-sails,
and duty called me away. I left the ladies
in the charge of Mr. St. Clair, and hurried to my
post. For the next half hour I was so occupied that
I had little opportunity to think of Annette, and indeed
the most of my time was spent below in superintending
the work of the men. When I returned
on deck the chase was progressing with vigor, and
it was very evident that <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE ARROW</span>, though a fast
sailer, was hard pressed. Every stitch of canvass
that could be made to draw was spread, but the
stranger astern had, notwithstanding, considerably
increased on the horizon since I left the deck. The
officers were beginning to exchange ominous looks,
and the faces of our passengers wore an anxious
expression. One or two of the older members of
the crew were squinting suspiciously at the stranger.
The captain however wore his usual open front, but
a close observer might have noticed that my superior
glanced every moment at the pursuer, and then ran
his eye as if unconsciously up our canvass. At this
moment the cry of a sail rang down from the mast-head,
startling us as if we had heard a voice from the
dead, for so intense had been the interest with which
we had regarded our pursuer that not an eye gazed
in any direction except astern. The captain looked
quickly around the horizon, and hailing the look-out,
shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whereaway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the starboard-bow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he look like?” continued Captain
Smythe to me, for I had taken the glass at once and
was now far on my way to the cross-trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He seems a craft about as heavy as our own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How now?” asked the captain, when sufficient
space had elapsed to allow the top-sails of the new
visiter to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has the jaunty cut of a corvette!” I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short space of time—a delay of breathless interest—sufficed
to betray the character of the ship ahead.
She proved, as I had expected, a corvette. Nor
were we long left in doubt as to her flag, for the red
field of St. George shot up to her gaff, and a cannon
ball ricochetting across the waves, plumped into
the sea a few fathoms ahead of our bow. For a moment
we looked at each other in dismay at this new
danger. We saw that we were beset. A powerful
foe was coming up with us hand over hand astern, and
a craft fully our equal was heading us off. Escape
seemed impossible. The ladies, who still kept
the deck, turned pale and clung closer to their protector’s
arm. The crew were gloomy. The officers
looked perplexed. But the imperturbable calm of the
captain suffered no diminution. He had already ordered
the crew to their quarters, and the decks
were now strewed with preparations for the strife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will fight him,” he said; “we will cripple
or sink him, and then keep on our way. But let
not a shot be fired until I give the order. Steady,
quartermaster, steady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time I had descended to the deck, ready to
take my post at quarters. The ladies still kept the
deck, but the captain’s eye happening to fall on them,
the stern expression of his countenance gave way to
one of a milder character, and, approaching them, he
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid, my dear Miss St. Clair, that this
will soon be no place for you or your fair companion.
Allow me to send you to a place of safety. Ah!
here is Mr. Cavendish, he will conduct you below.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Mr. Cavendish,” said Isabel, with a tremulous
voice, “is there any chance of escape?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Annette did not speak, but she looked up into my
face with an anxious expression, while the color
went and came in her cheek. My answer was a
confident assertion of victory, although, God knows,
I scarcely dared to entertain the hope of such a result.
It reassured my fair companions, however, and
I thought that the eyes of Annette at least expressed
the gratitude which did not find vent in words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will not forget you in our prayers,” said Isabel,
as I prepared to reascend to the deck, “farewell—may—may
we meet again!” and she extended her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you and our other defenders,” said
Annette. She would have added more, but her
voice lost its firmness. She could only extend her
hand. I grasped it, pressed it betwixt both of mine,
and then tore myself away. As I turned from them,
I thought I heard a sob. I know that a tear-drop was
on that delicate hand when I pressed it in my own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I reached the deck, I found Mr. St. Clair
already at his post, for he had volunteered to aid in
the approaching combat. Nor was that combat long
delayed. We were now close on to the corvette,
but yet not a shot had been fired from our batteries,
although the enemy was beginning a rapid and
furious cannonade, under which our brave tars
chafed like chained lions. Many a tanned and sun-browned
veteran glared fiercely on the foe, and even
looked curiously and doubtingly on his officers, as
the balls of the corvette came hustling rapidly and
more rapidly towards us, and when at length a shot
dismounted one of our carriages and laid four of our
brave fellows dead on the deck, the excitement of
the men became almost uncontrollable. At this
instant, however, the corvette yawed, bore up, and
ran off with the wind on his quarter. Quick as
lightning Captain Smythe availed himself of the
bravado.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lay her alongside, quartermaster,” he thundered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir,” answered the old water-rat, and
during a few breathless moments of suspense we
crowded silently after the corvette. That suspense,
however, was of short duration. We were now on
the quarter of the enemy. The captain paused no
longer, but waving his sword, he shouted “<span style='font-size:smaller'>FIRE</span>,”
and simultaneously our broadside was poured in,
like a hurricane of fire, on the foe. Nor during ten
minutes was there any intermission in our fire. The
combat was terrific. The men jerked out their
pieces like playthings, and we could soon hear over
even the din of the conflict, the crashing of the
enemy’s hull and the falling of his spars. The rapidity
and certainty of our fire meanwhile seemed to
have paralysed the foe, for his broadsides were delivered
with little of the fury which we had been led
to expect. His foremast at length went by the
board. The silence of our crew was now first
broken, and a deafening huzza rose up from them,
shaking the very welkin with the uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another broadside, my brave fellows,” said
Captain Smythe, “and then lay aloft and crowd all
sail—I think she’ll hardly pursue us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huzza, boys, pour it into her,” shouted a grim
visaged captain of a gun, “give her a parting shake,
huzza!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a volcano in its might—like an earthquake
reeling by—sped that fearful broadside on its errand.
We did not pause to see what damage we had done,
but while the ship yet quivered with the discharge
the men sprang aloft, and before the smoke had rolled
away from the decks our canvass was once more
straining in the breeze and we were rapidly leaving
our late enemy. When the prospect cleared up
we could see her lying a hopeless wreck astern.
The frigate which, during the conflict, had drawn
close upon us, was now sending her shots like hail-stones
over us, but when she came abreast of her consort
she was forced to stop, as our late foe by this
time had hung out a signal of distress. We could see
that boats, laden with human beings, were putting off
from the corvette to the frigate, which proved that
our late antagonist was in a sinking condition. Before
an hour she blew up with a tremendous explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was the first one to hurry below and relieve the
suspense of Annette and her cousin by apprising
them of our success. A few hours repaired the damage
we had sustained, and before night-fall the frigate
was out of sight astern. So ended our first
conflict with our enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> artisan whom we left mounted on Lord Dudley’s
charger was, much against his inclinations,
swept onward by the crowd, till he found himself
heading, like a single item of cavalry, upon the body
of Somerset men now drawn up directly before him.
He had no power to change his course or dismount
from the conspicuous situation which placed him in
full view of both parties, and which, under all the
circumstances, was rather annoying to a man of his
retiring and modest nature. Still he exerted himself
to restrain the onward course of his charger with
one hand, while the other was bent in and the fingers
clenched together over the edge of his sleeve with a
prudent regard for the diamond ring and the emeralds
which had been so hastily bestowed there. All at
once he gave a start that almost unclenched the
grasp upon his sleeve and jerked the bridle with a
vehemence which brought the red and foaming
mouth of the spirited animal he bestrode down upon
his chest with a violence that sent the foam flying like
a storm of snowflakes over his black shoulders and
mane. The proud and fretted creature gave an angry
snort and recoiled madly under this rough treatment.
With burning eyes and a fiercer toss of the head he
recovered himself and leaped into the midst of a
body of armed horsemen which that moment formed
a line across the street, just above St. Margaret’s,
and backed by an armed force, was slowly driving

occupied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plunge was so sudden and furious that a
slightly built but stern and aristocratic man, who rode
in the centre of his party, was almost unhorsed by
the shock, and a great deal of confusion was created
among the horses and people thus forced back upon
those eagerly pressing toward the church. The man,
who had been so nearly flung from his saddle,
fiercely curbed his plunging horse, and pressing his
feet hard in the broad stirrups, regained his position,
but with a pale face and eyes flashing fire at the rude
assault which he believed to have been purposely
made upon his person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, ho! take yon caitiff in charge,” he
shouted, pointing sternly with his drawn sword toward
the artisan, “or cleave him to the earth a base
leader of a rabble as he seems.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the fiery and still restive charger was
seized by the bit, a dozen hands were laid upon the
pale and frightened being who crouched upon his
back, and he was drawn face to face with Somerset,
the Lord Protector of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in the abject and insignificant
figure of the artisan which made the stern anger
levelled at him by the haughty man before whom he
was forced almost ludicrous. This thought seemed
to present itself to the Lord Protector, for his mouth
relaxed into a contemptuous smile as he gazed upon
his prisoner, and letting his sword drop as if it had
been a riding whip, he gave a careless order that the
man should be secured, and was about to move forward
when his eye fell upon the rich housings of
Lord Dudley’s charger. At first a look of surprise
arose to his face, which gradually bent his brow into
a heavy and portentous frown. Once more lifting
his sword, he pointed toward the horse, demanding
in a stern voice of the artisan, how he came there,
and so mounted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it please your highness,” faltered the artisan,
resuming something of his natural audacity when
he saw that there was a chance of extricating himself
by craft rather than blows,—“May it please your
highness, the horse belongs to my good Lord of Dudley
whom I left but now among the rioters yonder.
They lack a leader and cannot spare him yet, or he
would vouch for my honesty and care which I have
taken to bestow myself and the good horse into safe
quarters without meddling hand or foot in this
affray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how came Lord Dudley or his charger at
St. Margaret’s?” said Somerset, frowning still more
heavily, “answer the truth now—how came your
lord here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artisan seemed at a loss how to reply; but
when the Protector grew impatient, he shook his
head with a look of shrewd meaning, and said that
his lord had ridden forth to seek a fair lady in the
morning who had promised him a meeting somewhere
in the neighborhood, but that being called
upon by the mob, he had led the rioters for a time in
their attack upon the workmen, and at last had joined
them on foot, consigning the charger to his, the artisan’s
care, and that was all he knew of the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think ye this varlet speaks truth,” said Somerset,
bending to a nobleman who rode at his left hand,
“or does he make up this tale of the lady to screen
the premeditated share his master has taken in this
riot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has a lying face,” replied the person thus
consulted, “the look of an unwashed dog, and but
for the charger which speaks for itself, and the cry
which arose but now from the heart of the mob, I
should doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, it must be true, traitor as he looks,” exclaimed
Somerset, abruptly interrupting the other,
“how could I expect aught else from a Warwick?
root and branch they are all alike, ambitious and full
of treachery. Take this man in charge!” he called
aloud to those about him, “and see that he find no
means of escape. And now on, my good men, that
we may face this young traitor in the midst of his
rabble followers—a glorious band to be led on by
a Warwick!” he added, tossing a scornful glance
over the rude throng which was beginning to give
way before the long pikes of his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artisan, who had been allowed to sit freely on
his horse while under examination, was again seized
at the command of Somerset; but this time he refused
to submit tamely to the hands laid upon him. In the
struggle his fingers were torn from their hold on his
sleeve, and the stolen jewels fell sparkling upon the
long black mane of the charger. Before he could free
his hands and snatch them up, they were observed
and secured by one of the men to whom he had been
consigned, who approached the Lord Protector, as
he finished his scornful comment on the rioters, and
laid them in his hand, informing him how they had
been obtained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somerset glanced carelessly at the jewels, and
was about to return them, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will attend to it all anon; keep strict guard
of the wretch and see that he does not escape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had dropped part of the gems into the messenger’s
hand again, when his eye fell upon the ring;
instantly the color flashed up to his forehead, and he
examined the stones with an intense interest, amounting
almost to agitation, for they circled his own
family crest, and not many hours before he had seen
them on the hand of his youngest and favorite
daughter. He cast a keen glance on the man who
had brought the jewels to him, as if to ascertain if
he had discovered the crest, and then quietly reaching
forth his hand he took the emeralds, examined
them closely, and forcing his horse up to the artisan,
motioned that those around him should draw back.
He was obeyed so far as the crowd would permit,
and then drawing close to the prisoner, with a face
almost as white and agitated as his own, he demanded
in a low severe voice how he came in possession of
the jewels?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did I come in possession? May it please
your highness, as an honest man should. The ring
was given me by a fair lady for good service rendered
in bringing her and her sweet-heart together;
and as for the green stones there, which may be of
value and may not, there is no gold about them; and
I have my doubts, for in these cases I have always
found the lady most liberal of the party—for the
emeralds—why my young master was generous as
well as the lady—and well he might be, for I had
much ado to bring them together, besides fighting
through the crowd, and caring for the horse, and
helping my lord to make a passage for his light-o-love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hound! speak the word again and I will cleave
thee to the earth, if it be with my own sword, loth
as I am to stain it so foully!” said Somerset in a
voice of intense rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did but answer the question your highness
put,” replied the artisan cringingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace!” commanded the Protector. After a
moment, he said with more calmness, but still in the
low and stern voice of concentrated anger⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know you the lady’s name who gave you this
ring?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord called her Jane, or Lady Jane, which
may be the true name and may not—such light-o’—I
crave your highness’ pardon—such ladies sometimes
have as many names as lovers—and this one may be
Lady Jane to my lord, and Mistress Jane, or Mary,
or⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough,” interrupted the Protector—“and this
ring was given by the—a lady to reward thee for
bringing her to an interview with Lord Dudley.
How happened it that thy services were required?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as near as I can understand the matter,”
replied the artisan, somewhat reassured by the low
calm tone of his questioner, though there was something
in the stern face that made his heart tremble, he
knew not why, “the lady, whoever she be, was to
have met my lord somewhere near the church yonder,
but when he came to meet one person, behold a
whole parish of hotheaded people had taken possession,
so instead of a love passage he consoled himself
by turning captain of the riot, and played the
leader to a marvel, as your highness may have heard
by the clamorous outcry with which he was cheered
by the mob. I am but an humble man and content
me with looking on in a broil, so as I bestowed myself
to a safe corner, behold the fair lady of the ring had
taken shelter there also, and at her entreaties, urged
in good sooth by a host of tears and those sparklers
almost as bright, she won me to give my lord an
inkling of her whereabouts, so as much for the bright
tears as the gems I fought my way through the mob
and whispered a word in the eagle’s ears, which soon
brought him from his war flight to the dove cot,
whereupon he gave me charge of the horse here,
and, taking the lady under his arm, went⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whither, sirrah, whither did he take her?” said
the Lord Protector, in a voice that frightened the
man, for it came through his clenched teeth scarcely
louder than a whisper, and yet so distinct that it fell
upon his ear sharply amid all the surrounding din.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I lost sight of them in the crowd, for this strong-bitted
brute was enough to manage without troubling
myself with love matters. They were together, I
had my reward, and that is the long and short of the
matter,” replied the artisan, mingling truth and falsehood
with no little address, considering the state of
terror into which he had been thrown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thou art ignorant where she is now?”
inquired Somerset, still in a calm constrained voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, your highness. Lord Dudley has doubtless
nestled his dove into some safe nook hereabouts,
while he leads on the rioters near the church. I
heard them shouting his name just as your lordly
followers seized my mettlesome beast by the bit. So
there is little fear that he will not be found all in good
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lord Protector turned away his head and
wheeled his horse around without speaking a word,
but his followers were struck by the fierce deep light
that burned in his eyes and the extraordinary whiteness
of his face. The artisan took this movement as
a sign of his own liberation, and, glad to escape
even with the loss of his plunder, he gathered up the
bridle and was about to push his way from a presence
that filled him with fear and trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lord Protector’s quick eye caught the motion,
and, as if all the passions of his nature broke forth
in the command, he thundered out⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seize that man and take good care that he
neither speaks nor is spoken to. God of Heaven!”
he added, suddenly bending forward with all the
keen anguish of a father and a disgraced noble breaking
over his pale features as they almost touched the
saddle-bow—“Father of Heaven, that the honor of a
brave house should lie at the mercy of a slippery
knave’s tongue!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words, spoken in a low stifled voice, were
lost amid the din of surrounding strife; but instantly
that pale proud head was lifted again and turned
almost fierce upon his followers. The naked sword
flashed upward, and a shout, like that of a wounded
eagle fierce in his death-struggle, broke upon his
white lips and rang almost like a shriek upon the
burthened air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On to the church—on, on through the mob—trample
them to the earth till we stand face to face
with the leader!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the men with their long pikes made a
rush upon the multitude. The horsemen plunged
recklessly forward, crushing the unarmed people
to the earth, and trampling the warm life from many
a human heart beneath the hoofs of their chargers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the cry and struggle which arose from this
onset that reached the Lord Dudley in the dim and
solemn quietude of St. Margaret’s church. It was
this which made the Lady Jane spring wildly upon
the altar where she had been extended so weak and
helpless, put back the hair from her face and listen,
white and breathless as a statue, for another sound
of her father’s voice like the one shrill war-cry that
had cut to her heart like a denunciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Dudley hurried down the aisle again, for
there was something in the wild terror of her look
that made him forgetful of everything but her. As
his foot was lifted upon the first step of the altar,
the tumult increased around the church till its foundation
seemed tottering beneath the levers of a
thousand fiends, all fierce and clamorous for a fragment
of the sacred pile. There was a sound of heavy
weapons battering against the entrance. Shout rang
upon shout—a terrible crash—the great arched window
was broken in. A fragment of the stone casement
fell upon the baptismal font, forcing it in twain
and dashing the consecrated water about till the censers
and velvet footcloths were deluged with it. A
storm of painted glass filled the church—whirled
and flashed in the burst of sunshine, thus rudely let
in, and fell upon the white altar-stone, and the
scarcely less white beings that stood upon it, like a
shower of gems shattered and ground to powder in
their fall. Then the door gave way, and those who
had kept guard rushed in with uplifted hands, and
faces filled with terrible indignation, beseeching
Lord Dudley to arouse himself and come to their aid
against the tyrant who even then was planting his
foot upon the ashes of their dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no time for deliberation or delay; the foundation
of the church shook beneath their feet, a body
of armed men hot with anger and chafed by opposition
thundered at the scarcely bolted entrance. Perhaps
the brave blood which burned in Dudley’s veins,
urged him on to the step which now seemed unavoidable.
Still he would have died, like a lion in
his lair, rather than become in any way the leader
of a mob, but he could not see that bright and gentle
being, so good and so beloved, perish by the violence
of her own father. He snatched her from the altar
where she stood, and bearing her to a corner of the
church most distant from the entrance, forced her
clinging arms from his neck, pressed his lips hurriedly
to her forehead, and rushed toward the door,
followed by the men who had hitherto guarded it.
The effort proved a useless one. The doors were
blocked up by a phalanx of parishioners, and he
could not make himself known or force a passage
out. The brave band was almost crushed between
the walls of the church and the Lord Protector, who,
with his horsemen, had driven them back, step by
step, till they were wedged together, resolute but
almost helpless from want of room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the window—stand beneath that I may mount
by your shoulders,” exclaimed Dudley to the men
who surrounded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the group gathered in a compact knot
beneath the shattered window. Lord Dudley sprang
upon the sort of platform made by their shoulders,
and thence, with a vigorous leap to the stone sill
where he stood, exposed and unarmed before the
people—his cloak swaying loosely back from his
shoulder—his cap off and his fine hair falling in damp
heavy curls over his pale forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A joyful shout and a fierce cry burst from the
multitude and mingled together as he appeared before
them. A world of flashing eyes and working
faces was uplifted to the window, and for a moment
the strife raging about the church was relaxed, for
men were astonished by his appearance there, almost
in open rebellion, face to face with the Lord Protector.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring that man to the earth dead,” shouted
Somerset, pointing toward the young nobleman,
“and then set fire to the building, to-morrow shall
not see a single stone in its place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shower of deadly missiles flew around the young
noble, but he sprang unhurt into the midst of the
throng, which made way for him to pass till he stood
front to front with the man who had just commanded
his death. Somerset turned deadly pale, and, clenching
his teeth with intense rage, lifted his sword with
both hands, as if to cleave the youth through the
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord Duke,” said Dudley, in a manner so
calm that it arrested the proud nobleman’s hand,
though his weapon was still kept uplifted, “I do
beseech your grace draw the soldiers away; the
parishioners are furious, and I am convinced will
defend the church till you trample an entrance over
their dead bodies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley spoke respectfully and as a son to his
parent, but with much agitation, for everything that
he held dear seemed involved in the safety of the
church. He knew that estrangement existed between
the duke and his own noble father, but up to
that moment had no idea that his personal favor with
Somerset was in the least impaired. He had not
believed that the command levelled against his life
was indeed intended for him, and was therefore both
astonished and perplexed when the duke bent his
face bloodless and distorted with rage close down to
his and exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dastard and traitor! where is my child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is yonder within the church,” replied Dudley
with prompt and manly courage. “Safe, thank
God! as yet, but if this fierce assault continue she
must perish in the ruin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So shall it be,” replied the Protector fiercely.
“Let her life and her shame be buried together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her shame, my Lord Duke,” said Dudley, laying
his hand on Somerset’s bridle-rein, and meeting the
stern glance fixed on him with one full of proud
feeling. “Another lip than yours had not coupled
such words with the pure name of Jane Seymour,
and lived to utter another. But you are her father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, to my curse and bitter shame be it said, I
<span class='it'>am</span> her father,” replied the duke, “and have
power to punish both the victim and the tempter.
Your conduct, base son of a baser father, shall be
answered for before the king, but first stand by and
see your weak victim meet the reward of her art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, Somerset grasped the youth by his
arm, and hurling him among his followers, shouted,
“secure the traitor, or if he resist cut him down.
Now on to the attack. A hundred pounds to the first
man who forces an entrance to the church. Set fire
to it if our strength be not enough, and let no one
found there escape alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The confusion which followed this order was
instant and tremendous. The mob rushed fiercely
upon the Protector in a fruitless effort to rescue Lord
Dudley, while the soldiers sprang forward upon the
building, and half a score were seen clambering like
wild animals along the rough stone-work toward the
windows, for still the mob kept possession of the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group which we left within the church hearing
this command, looked sternly into each other’s faces,
and their leader—he who had admitted Dudley and
his companion—was aided by his friends, and sprang
within the shattered window just as the head of a
clambering assailant was raised above the sill. The
sexton, for the man held that office in the church,
planted one foot upon the soldier’s fingers, when
they clung with a fierce gripe upon the stone, and
stooping down he secured the poor fellow by both
shoulders, bent him back till his body was almost
doubled, and then with hands and foot spurned him
from the wall with a violence that hurled him many
paces into the crowd. Another and another shared
the fate of this unfortunate man, and there stood the
sexton, unharmed, guarding the pass like a lion at bay,
and tearing up fragments of stone to hurl at the
soldiers whenever he was not compelled to act on
the defensive; but his situation soon became very
critical, for his station became the point of general
attack, and Somerset’s voice was still heard fiercely
ordering his men to fire the building; for a moment
the shower of missiles hurled from the soldiers beat
him down, and he was forced to spring into the
church among his companions again for shelter.
The poor young lady heard the savage command
of her parent, and, rushing to the men, frantically besought
them to inform the Duke of Somerset his
child was in the building, and that, she was certain,
would save it from destruction. There was something
in the helplessness and touching beauty of that
young creature as she stood before them, wringing
her hands, and with tears streaming down her pale
cheek, that touched the men with compassion, or she
might have perished by their hands when her connection
with their oppressor was made known. They
looked in each other’s faces and a few rapid words
passed between them. The sexton sprang once
more upon the window, the rest turned upon the terrified
lady and she was lifted from hand to hand, till
at last they placed her by his side, trembling and
almost senseless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold,” cried the sexton, lifting the poor girl
up before the multitude and flinging back the hair
from her pale and affrighted features, that her father
might recognise them, and feel to his heart, all the
indignity and peril of her position. “Behold, I say,
lift but another pike, hurl a stone but the size of a
hazelnut against these walls, and this proud lady
shall share them all side by side with the humble
sexton. My Lord of Somerset,” he shouted,
grasping the lady firm with one arm, as if about to
hurl her from the window, “Draw off your soldiers,
leave these old walls, where we may worship our
God in peace, or I will hurl your child into the midst
of my brethren, that she may be trampled beneath
their feet, even as you have crushed human limbs
this day under your iron-shod war horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words were uttered by a rude man, but excitement
had made him eloquent, and his voice rang
over the crowd like the blast of a trumpet. When
he ceased speaking, a silence almost appalling, after
the previous wild sounds, fell upon the multitude.
The horsemen stayed their swords, and the soldiers
stood with their pikes half lifted, and Somerset himself
sat like one stupified by the sudden apparition of
his child; among all that rude throng there was no
hand brutal enough to lift itself against that beautiful
and trembling girl, but many a glistening eye turned
from her to the stern but now agonized face of the
duke, anxious that he should draw off his men. He
was very pale, his lip quivered for a moment, and
then his face hardened again like marble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her blood be upon thy head, young man,” he
exclaimed, bending his keen but troubled eyes on
Lord Dudley, who stood vainly struggling with his
captors; then lifting his voice he cried out,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tear down the church; neither wall of stone nor
human being must stop our way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still a profound silence lay upon the multitude.
There was something horrible in the command that
caused the coarsest heart to revolt at its cruelty. So
still and motionless remained the throng that the
faint shriek which died on the pale lips of that helpless
girl as her father’s command fell upon her ear,
was distinctly heard even by the stern parent himself.
He lifted his eyes to the place where she was kneeling,
her hands clasped, her face like marble, and
those eyes, usually so tranquil and dove-like, glittering
with terror and fixed imploringly upon his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned away his head and tried to repeat his
command, but the words died in his throat, and he
could not utter them. Again her locked hands were
extended, and her heart seemed breaking with wonder
at his cruelty as she uttered the single word,
“Father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That little word as it came like a frightened dove
over the listening mob, settled upon the heart of that
stern man, and awoke feelings which would not be
hushed again. It was the first word his child had
ever spoken. Her rosy infancy was before him—the
sweet smile, the soft tiny hands clasped triumphantly
together, when those syllables were mastered, seemed
playing with his heart-strings, the same heart
which had thrilled with so sweet a pleasure to her
infant greeting. It was a strange thing that these
memories should fall upon him when his passions
were all aroused and amid a concourse of rough contending
people, but the heart is an instrument of
many tones, and nature sometimes hangs forth its
sweetest music in singular places, and amid scenes
that we cannot comprehend. The Lord Protector
bent his head, for tears were in his eyes, and, like
many a being before and since, he was ashamed of
his better nature. At last he conquered his agitation,
and in a loud firm voice, commanded his soldiers to
withdraw, and pledged his knightly word to the
rioters that the church should receive no farther
injury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people were generally satisfied with this assurance,
and began to disperse when they saw the
soldiery filing away toward the river. The duke
dismissed his followers at the door of St. Margaret’s,
saw Lord Dudley conducted from his presence under
a strong guard, and then entered the church alone
and much agitated. He found his child sitting upon
a step of the altar, shivering as with cold, and with
her face buried in her hands. She knew his step as
he came slowly down the aisle, and lifted her dim
eyes with a look of touching appeal to his face. It
was stern, cold, and unforgiving. She arose timidly
and moved with a wavering step to meet him. His
face was still averted, but she reached up her arms,
wound them about his neck, and swooned away with
her cheek pressed to his, like a grieved child that had
sobbed itself to sleep. Again the thoughts of her infancy
came to his heart, and though it was wrung
with a belief that she had been very blameable and
had trifled with her proud name, she was senseless
and could not know that he had caressed her as of
old; so the stern man bent his head and wept, as he
kissed her forehead.</p>

<div><h1><a id='dick'></a>ORIGINAL LETTER</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:0.5em;font-weight:bold;'>FROM</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.2em;font-weight:bold;'>CHARLES DICKENS.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[For the truly characteristic letter here published, and for the sketch which accompanies it, we are indebted to the
obliging attention of <span class='sc'>Mr. John Tomlin</span> of Tennessee.—With our own warm admiration of the writings and character
of Dickens we can well understand and easily pardon the enthusiasm of our friend.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> setting about that most difficult of all tasks, the
sketching of the character of a living author, I feel
that I cannot entirely keep clear of that weakness of
the human mind, which praises the foibles of a friend
and condemns the virtues of an enemy. There is no
task more difficult of performance than the one I
have imposed upon myself—no task but what can be
more easily performed correctly, than the presentation
to the world, in their nice distinctive shades, of
living characters. To admire one is to praise him—and
to cover all of his faults in the blindness of charity,
is the weakness of our nature. It is scarcely possible
then, Mr. Poe, for one like me, whose love is as
strong as the faith of the martyr, when at the stake
he expires, and whose hate is as deep as the depths
of the sea, to shun the errors that almost every one
has fallen into, who undertakes the task of sketching
characters, <span class='it'>life-like</span>, of eminent living individuals.—To
succeed partially is in my power, and in the power
of almost every one, but to succeed wholly in introducing
to the mind’s eye the character as it really is,
of any individual, is scarcely possible. I will not say
that I am peculiarly fitted to shine in this province,
nor will I say that I am equal to the task that I have
voluntarily imposed upon myself—but I will say that
everything I say will be said from a conviction of
belief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nay, do not start and turn pale, gentle reader, when
I tell you that “Boz,” the inimitable “Boz,” is the
subject of the present sketch. It is indeed true
that Charles Dickens, the great English author—he
who lives in London amid the exciting scenes and
struggles of this world’s great Metropolis, is now
about to be “talked off,” by a backwoodsman—but he
will do it with an <span class='it'>admiring</span> reverence, and a <span class='it'>most
partial</span> discretion. I will not speak of his published
works, for they have been numbered among our
household gods,—nor of the genius of the mind that
has made them such. So long as there is mind to
appreciate the high conceptions of mind, and a taste
to admire the purity of thought, so long will Charles
Dickens live “the noblest work of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles Dickens as an author is too well known
for me to say aught for or against him. It is only in
his private capacity will I speak—only as Charles
Dickens, the private man. Those social qualities of
the nature so requisite in the making up of a
good man, belong to him essentially and justly.
He could not be Charles Dickens and have not
those qualities of the soul which but few possess.
Had all of us the true nobility of nature, all of us
would be like him in spirit. There is in him a gentleness
that commands our love as much as his genius
has our admiration. The kindness of his nature is
as great as his talent is pre-eminent. He could never
be otherwise than “Boz” nor less than Charles
Dickens—the being of all kindly feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dwelling in a little hamlet that is scarcely known
beyond the sound of its church bell—and in a place
that a few years ago, resounded only to the winds of
the magic woods, or the moccasin tread of the Indian
on the dry leaves,—I, a creature less known by far
than my village, addressed a letter to “Boz,” and, in
answer from him, received the following letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“1 Devonshire Terrace, York Gate.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1.5em;'>Regent’s Park, London.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;margin-bottom:0.5em;'>Tuesday, Twenty-third February, 1841.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>:—You are quite right in feeling assured
that I should answer the letter you have addressed
to me. If you had entertained a presentiment that
it would afford me sincere pleasure and delight to
hear from a warm-hearted and admiring reader of
my books in the back-woods of America, you would
not have been far wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thank you cordially and heartily, both for your
letter, and its kind and courteous terms. To think
that I have awakened a fellow-feeling and sympathy
with the creatures of many thoughtful hours among
the vast solitudes in which you dwell, is a source of
the purest delight and pride to me; and believe me
that your expressions of affectionate remembrance
and approval, sounding from the great forests on the
banks of the Mississippi, sink deeper into my heart
and gratify it more than all the honorary distinctions
that all the courts in Europe could confer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is such things as these that make one hope one
does not live in vain, and that are the highest reward
of an author’s life. To be numbered among the
household gods of one’s distant countrymen and associated
with their homes and quiet pleasures—to be
told that in each nook and corner of the world’s
great mass there lives one well-wisher who holds
communion with one in the spirit—is a worthy fame
indeed, and one which I would not barter for a mine
of wealth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That I may be happy enough to cheer some of your
leisure hours for a very long time to come, and to
hold a place in your pleasant thoughts is the earnest
wish of Boz.—And with all good wishes for yourself,
and with a sincere reciprocation of all your kindly
feeling, I am, Dear Sir,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;margin-top:0.5em;'>Faithfully Yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Charles Dickens</span>.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:2em;'><span class='sc'>Mr. John Tomlin.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Can anything be more <span class='it'>unique</span>—or more sweetly
beautiful than this letter? In it there is the poetry of
feeling warmed into life by his sympathies with the
“creatures of many thoughtful hours.” The brain
has never yet loosened from her alembic fountain,
and dropped upon an author’s page, thoughts
more gem-like than those that we see sparkling like
diamonds in his letter. Time in her ravages on the
thoughts of the departed never harvested more
sparkling things than what appears here from the
granary of “Boz’s” original mind. Throughout
there is a tenderness breathing its seer-like influence
on every thought, until it seems to become hallowed
like the spirit-dream of a lover’s hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great difference between mankind is, that
there is a feeling of kindness in the heart of some
that is not possessed by others. To live in this world
without conferring on others, benefits, is to live
without a purpose. Of what value to our fellow
creatures is mind, no matter how splendidly adorned,
if it bestows no favors on them? The rich gems
that lie buried in the caves of the oceans, are not in
their secret caves intrinsically less valuable, but their
value is really not known until they yield a profit.—Napoleon
in his granite mind impressed no stamp of
heaven on his countrymen. Hard as the winter of
his Russian Service lived his life on the memory of
man! Frozen tears as thickly as hail-drops from a
thunder-shower fell from the eyes of his army to
blight and wither the affections of civilized Europe.
In his life he toiled for a name which he won at the
sacrifice of the lives of millions, and perished a
prisoner on a bleak and rocky isle of the ocean!—The
splendid intellect of Byron, more dazzling than
the sunbeam from a summer sky, by one untoward
circumstance came to prey upon every good feeling
of his heart—and what was he?—a misanthrope!—That
ill-fated and persecuted star, P. B. Shelley,
what could he not have been, had the genius of his
high-toned feelings been directed aright?</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all of the genius of these three beings Charles
Dickens has a good heart, with all of the philanthropy
and patriotism of a Washington. How few
indeed are the great men that have lived in any age
or in any country whose social qualities of the
heart have not been materially injured, and in many
instances totally destroyed, by eccentric peculiarities.
Sometimes these peculiarities are real, but mostly
have they been assumed. To be as nature made us
is hardly possible now with any being who has the
least prospect of a brilliant career in the world of
letters. When nature bestows her high endowments
on the mind, the favored one immediately aspires
to oddity, and often to insanity,—and makes a
non-descript of his genius. To have the world’s
affability, and those social qualities of the heart that
give so much of happiness and pleasure to our fellow
creatures, is not considered by a man of genius as a
thing at all worthy of possession, or as gifts adding
one lustre to the character. Instead of being as
they are, forming epochs in time and being bright
exemplars in the annals of chroniclers, which nature
intended them to do, they by the most odd monstrosities
endeavor to mar the genial warmth of the
feeling by misanthropic actions, and destroy from
their very foundation the most kindly emotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To see one of our fellow creatures on whom nature
has with an unsparing hand bestowed her best gifts,
doing deeds unworthy the high standing of his parentage,
and disgracing the purity of his privileges,
is to the noble in spirit the source of its most feverish
excitement. With the best of minds, organized artistically,
Byron fell into habits so monstrously bad,
that among the virtuous his name became a term
used in denoting disgrace. No excuse can be offered
for the man who has disgraced his name—no charity
is so blind as not to see the stain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the world’s history, as far back as the memory
reaches into the past, we have seen the most brilliant
minds, associated in connection with some of the
worst qualities of the heart. There is occasionally
some solitary instance, standing as some beautiful
<span class='it'>relief</span> on the epoch of time, of beings whose splendid
endowments of mind have not been more remarkable
in their era of history for talent, than the generous
breathings of the holy purity of heart have been for
kindness. Such cases as these are few, and happen
but seldom. In “Boz” these two qualities have met.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a clear bright day in the early autumn when
the royal tilt-yard, on the Isle de Paris, was prepared
for a deadly conflict. The tilt-yard was a regular,
oblong space, enclosed with stout squared palisades,
and galleries for the accommodation of spectators,
immediately in the vicinity of the royal residence of
the Tournelles, a splendid gothic structure, adorned
with all the rare and fanciful devices of that rich
style of architecture—at a short distance thence
arose the tall gray towers of Notre Dame, the bells
of which were tolling minutely the dirge for a passing
soul. From one of the windows of the palace a
gallery had been constructed, hung with rich crimson
tapestry, leading to a long range of seats,
cushioned and decked with arras, and guarded by a
strong party of gentlemen in the royal livery with
partizans in their hands and sword and dagger at
the belt—at either end of the list was a tent pitched,
that at the right of the royal gallery a plain marquee
of canvass of small size, which had apparently seen
much service, and been used in real warfare. The
curtain which formed the door of this was lowered,
so that no part of the interior could be seen from
without; but a particolored pennon was pitched into
the ground beside it, and a shield suspended from
the palisades, emblazoned with bearings, which all
men knew to be those of Charles Baron de La-Hirè,
a renowned soldier in the late Italian wars, and the
challenger in the present conflict. The pavilion at
the left, or lower end, was of a widely different
kind—of the very largest sort then in use, completely
framed of crimson cloth lined with white
silk, festooned and fringed with gold, and all the
curtains looped up to display a range of massive
tables covered with snow-white damask, and loaded
with two hundred covers of pure silver!—Vases of
flowers and flasks of crystal were intermixed upon
the board with tankards, flagons, and cups and urns
of gold, embossed and jewelled—and behind every
seat a page was placed, clad in the colors of the
Count de Laguy—a silken curtain concealed the
entrance of an inner tent, wherein the Count awaited
the signal that should call him to the lists.—Strange
and indecent as such an accompaniment would be
deemed now-a-days to a solemn mortal conflict—it
was then deemed neither singular nor monstrous—and
in this gay pavilion Armand de Laguy, the challenged
in the coming duel, had summoned all the
nobles of the court to feast with him, after he should
have slain, so confident was he of victory, his cousin
and accuser, Charles Baron de La-Hirè. The
entrances of the tilt-yard were guarded by a detachment
of the King’s sergeants, sheathed <span class='it'>cap-a-pié</span> in
steel, with shouldered arquebuses and matches
ready lighted—the lists were strewn with saw-dust
and hung completely with black serge, save where
the royal gallery afforded a strange contrast by its
rich decorations to the ghastly draperies of the battle-ground.
One other object only remains to be noticed;
it was a huge block of black-oak, dinted in many places
as if by the edge of a sharp weapon and stained with
plashes of dark gore. Beside this frightful emblem
stood a tall muscular gray-headed man, dressed in a
leathern frock and apron stained like the block with
many a gout of blood, bare-headed and bare-armed,
leaning upon a huge two-handed axe, with a blade
of three feet in breadth. A little way aloof from these
was placed a chair, wherein a monk was seated,
a very aged man with a bald head and beard as
white as snow, telling his beads in silence until his
ministry should be required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The space around the lists and all the seats were
crowded well nigh to suffocation by thousands of
anxious and attentive spectators; and many an eye
was turned to watch the royal seats which were yet
vacant, but which it was well known would be occupied
before the trumpet should sound for the onset.
The sun was now nearly at the meridian, and the
expectation of the crowd was at its height, when
the passing bell ceased ringing, and was immediately
succeeded by the accustomed peal, announcing the
hour of high noon. Within a moment or two, a
bustle was observed among the gentlemen pensioners—then
a page or two entered the royal seats,
and, after looking about them for a moment, again
retired. Another pause of profound expectation, and
then a long loud blast of trumpets followed from the
interior of the royal residence—nearer it rang, and
nearer, till the loud symphonies filled every ear and
thrilled to the core of every heart—and then the
King, the dignified and noble Henry, entered with all
his glittering court, princes and dukes, and peers and
ladies of high birth and matchless beauty, and took
their seats among the thundering acclamations of
the people, to witness the dread scene that was
about to follow, of wounds and blood and butchery.
All were arrayed in the most gorgeous splendor—all
except one, a girl of charms unrivalled, although
she seemed plunged in the deepest agony of grief,
by the seductive beauties of the gayest. Her bright
redundant auburn hair was all dishevelled—her long
dark eyelashes were pencilled in distinct relief
against the marble pallor of her colorless cheek—her
rich and rounded form was veiled, but not concealed,
by a dress of the coarsest serge, black as the robes
of night, and thereby contrasting more the exquisite
fairness of her complexion. On her all eyes were
fixed—some with disgust—some with contempt—others
with pity, sympathy, and even admiration.
That girl was Marguerite de Vaudreuil—betrothed
to either combatant—the betrayed herself and the
betrayer—rejected by the man whose memory, when
she believed him dead, she had herself deserted—rejecting
in her turn, and absolutely loathing him
whose falsehood had betrayed her into the commission
of a yet deeper treason. Marguerite de Vaudreuil,
lately the admired of all beholders, now the
prize of two kindred swordsmen, without an option
save that between the bed of a man she hated, and
the life-long seclusion of the convent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King was seated—the trumpets flourished once
again, and at the signal the curtain was withdrawn
from the tent door of the challenger, and Charles de
La-Hirè stepped calmly out on the arena, followed by
his godfather, De Jarnac, bearing two double-edged
swords of great length and weight, and two broad-bladed
poniards. Charles de La-Hirè was very pale
and sallow, as if from ill health or from long confinement,
but his step was firm and elastic, and his air
perfectly unmoved and tranquil; a slight flush rose
to his pale cheek as he was greeted by an enthusiastic
cheer from the people, to whom his fame in the
wars of Italy had much endeared him, but the flush
was transient, and in a moment he was as pale and
cold as before the shout which hailed his entrance.
He was clad very plainly in a dark morone-colored
pourpoint, with vest, trunk-hose, and nether stocks
of black silk netting, displaying to admiration the
outlines of his lithe and sinewy frame. De Jarnac,
his godfather, on the contrary, was very foppishly
attired with an abundance of fluttering tags and
ruffles of rich lace, and feathers in his velvet cap.
These two had scarcely stood a moment in the lists,
before, from the opposite pavilion, De Laguy and the
Duke de Nevers issued, the latter bearing, like De
Jarnac, a pair of swords and daggers; it was observed,
however, that the weapons of De Laguy
were narrow three-cornered rapier blades and Italian
stilettoes, and it was well understood that on the
choice of the weapons depended much the result of
the encounter—De Laguy being renowned above any
gentleman in the French court for his skill in the
science of defence, as practised by the Italian masters—while
his antagonist was known to excel in
strength and skill in the management of all downright
soldierly weapons, in coolness, in decision, presence
of mind, and calm self-sustained valor, rather than
in slight and dexterity. Armand de Laguy was
dressed sumptuously, in the same garb indeed which
he had worn at the festival whereon the strife arose
which now was on the point of being terminated—and
forever!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments were spent in deliberation between
the godfathers of the combatants, and then it was
proclaimed by De Jarnac, “that the wind and sun
having been equally divided between the two swordsmen,
their places were assigned—and that it remained
only to decide upon the choice of the
weapons!—that the choice should be regulated by a
throw of the dice—and that with the weapons so
chosen they should fight till one or other should be
<span class='it'>hors de combat</span>—but that in case that either weapon
should be bent or broken, the seconds should cry
‘hold,’ and recourse be had to the other swords—the
use of the poniard to be optional, as it was to be
used only for parrying, and not for striking—that
either combatant striking a blow or thrusting after
the utterance of the word ‘hold,’ or using the dagger
to inflict a wound, should be dragged to the block
and die the death of a felon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This proclamation made, dice were produced, and
De Nevers winning the throw for Armand, the rapiers
and stilettoes which he had selected were produced,
examined carefully, and measured, and delivered to
the kindred foemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a stern and fearful sight—for there was no
bravery nor show in their attire, nor aught chivalrous
in the way of battle. They had thrown off their coats
and hats, and remained in their shirt sleeves and
under garments only, with napkins bound about their
brows, and their eyes fixed each on the other’s with
intense and terrible malignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The signal was now given and the blades were
crossed—and on the instant it was seen how fearful
was the advantage which De Laguy had gained by
the choice of weapons—for it was with the utmost
difficulty that Charles de La-Hirè avoided the incessant
longes of his enemy, who springing to and fro,
stamping and writhing his body in every direction,
never ceased for a moment with every trick of feint
and pass and flourish to thrust at limb, face and body,
easily parrying himself with the poniard, which he
held in his left hand, the less skilful assaults of his
enemy. Within five minutes the blood had been
drawn in as many places, though the wounds were
but superficial, from the sword-arm, the face and
thigh of De La-Hirè, while he had not as yet pricked
ever so lightly his formidable enemy—his quick eye,
however, and firm active hand stood him in stead,
and he contrived in every instance to turn the thrusts
of Armand so far at least aside as to render them innocuous
to life. As his blood, however, ebbed away,
and as he knew that he must soon become weak
from the loss of it, De Jarnac evidently grew uneasy,
and many bets were offered that Armand would kill
him without receiving so much as a scratch himself.
And now Charles saw his peril, and determined
on a fresh line of action—flinging away his
dagger, he altered his position rapidly, so as to bring
his left hand toward De Laguy, and made a motion
with it, as if to grasp his sword-hilt—he was
immediately rewarded by a longe, which drove
clear through his left arm close to the elbow joint
but just above it—De Jarnac turned on the instant
deadly pale, for he thought all was over—but he
erred widely, for De La-Hirè had calculated well his
action and his time, and that which threatened to
destroy him proved, as he meant it, his salvation—for
as quick as light when he felt the wound he dropped
his own rapier, and grasping Armand’s guard
with his right hand, he snapped the blade short off
in his own mangled flesh and bounded five feet backward,
with the broken fragment still sticking in his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold!” shouted each godfather on the instant—and
at the same time De La-Hirè exclaimed, “give
us the other swords—give us the other swords, De
Jarnac⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exchange was made in a moment, the stilettoes
and the broken weapons were gathered up, and the
heavy horse-swords given to the combatants, who
again faced each other with equal resolution, though
now with altered fortunes. “Now De La-Hirè,”
exclaimed De Jarnac, as he put the well poised blade
into his friend’s hand—“you managed that right gallantly
and well—now fight the quick fight, ere you
shall faint from pain and bleeding!”—and it was instantly
apparent that such was indeed his intention—his
eye lightened, and he looked like an eagle about
to pounce upon his foe, as he drew up his form to its
utmost height and whirled the long new blade about
his head as though it had been but a feather. Far
less sublime and striking was the attitude and swordsmanship
of De Laguy, though he too fought both
gallantly and well. But at the fifth pass, feinting at
his head, Charles fetched a long and sweeping blow
at his right leg, and striking him below the ham, divided
all the tendons with the back of the double-edged
blade—then springing in before he fell, plunged
his sword into his body, that the hilt knocked heavily
at his breast bone and the point came out glittering
between his shoulders—the blood flashed out from
the deep wound, from nose, and ears, and mouth, as
he fell prostrate, and Charles stood over him, leaning
on his avenging weapon and gazing sadly into his
stiffening features—“Fetch him a priest,” exclaimed
De Nevers—“for by my halidome he will not live
ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he live <span class='it'>five</span>,” cried the King rising from his
seat—“if he live <span class='it'>five</span>, he will live long enough to die
upon the block—for he lies there a felon and convicted
traitor, and by my soul he shall die a felon’s
doom—but bring him a priest quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old monk ran across the lists, and raised the
head of the dying man, and held the crucifix aloft
before his glazing eyes, and called upon him to
repent and to confess as he would have salvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faint and half choked with blood he faltered forth
the words—“I do—I do confess guilty—oh! double
guilty!—pardon! oh God—Charles!—Marguerite!”—and
as the words died on his quivering lips he sank
down fainting with the excess of agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho! there!—guards, headsman”—shouted Henry—“off
with him—off with the villain to the block, before
he die an honorable death by the sword of as
good a knight as ever fought for glory!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then De La-Hirè knelt down beside the dying man,
and took his hand in his own and raised it tenderly,
while a faint gleam of consciousness kindled the pallid
features—“May God as freely pardon thee as I do,
oh my cousin!”—then turning to the King—“You
have admitted, sire, that I have served you faithfully
and well—never yet have I sought reward at your
hand—let this now be my guerdon. Much have I
suffered, even thus let me not feel that my King has
increased my sufferings by consigning one of my
blood to the headsman’s blow—pardon him, sire, as
I do—who have the most cause of offence—pardon
him, gracious King, as we will hope that a King
higher yet shall pardon him and us, who be all sinners
in the sight of his all-seeing eye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it so,” answered Henry—“it never shall be
said of me that a French King refused his bravest
soldier’s first claim upon his justice—bear him to his
pavilion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they did bear him to his pavilion, decked as it
was for revelry and feasting, and they laid him there
ghastly and gashed and gory upon the festive board,
and his blood streamed among the choice wines, and
the scent of death chilled the rich fragrance of the
flowers—an hour! and he was dead who had invited
others to triumph over his cousin’s slaughter—an
hour! and the court lackeys shamefully spoiled and
plundered the repast which had been spread for
nobles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” continued Henry, taking the hand of
Marguerite—“Here is the victor’s prize—wilt have
him, Marguerite?—’fore heaven but he has won thee
nobly!—wilt have her, De La-Hirè, methinks her
tears and beauty may yet atone for fickleness produced
by treasons such as his who now shall never
more betray, nor lie, nor sin forever!⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sire,” replied De La-Hirè very firmly, “I pardon
her, I love her yet!—but I wed not dishonor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is right,” said the pale girl—“he is right, ever
right and noble—for what have such as I to do with
wedlock? Fare thee well!—Charles—dear, honored
Charles!—The mists of this world are clearing away
from mine eyes, and I see now that I loved thee best—thee
only! Fare thee well, noble one, forget the
wretch who has so deeply wronged thee—forget
me and be happy. For me I shall right soon be
free!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so—not so,” replied King Henry, misunderstanding
her meaning—“not so, for I have sworn it,
and though I may pity thee, I may not be forsworn—to-morrow
thou must to a convent, there to abide for
ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that will not be long,” answered the girl, a
gleam of her old pride and impetuosity lighting up
her fair features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By heaven, I say forever,” cried Henry, stamping
his foot on the ground angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I reply, not long!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>’Tis</span> Sunday!—Far to the westward lie the regions
of the Amazonians, and, in the east, the Caffre
hunts the ostrich. From the south, the lonely island
of Tristan d’Acunha looms high above the horizon.
Although twenty-three miles of water intervene between
us and the base of this extinct volcano, the
spray of the long billows of the southern ocean rises
in misty clouds above the perpendicular and rocky
shores, shading the mountain with a pearly veil,
widely different in color from the soft blue tint of
distance.—Even from the mast-head, whither the
desire of solitude has led me, the summits of three
or four billows complete the range of vision; for,
around the entire circuit of the earth, the eternal
west winds sweep, with scarce a barrier to their
action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To those who are familiar with the Atlantic only—that
comparatively diminutive expanse, which Humboldt
has appropriately called “an arm of the sea,”—the
extent of these mountain swells must appear
almost incredible. It is not their height—for this is
fixed within narrow limits by an immutable law—but
their vast, unbroken magnitude, that awes the observer
with the consciousness of infinite power. What
are the proudest monuments of human strength and
skill, dotting the surface of creation, when compared
with these majestic waves, which are themselves
but the ripple of a passing breeze?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reclining in the main-top, above all living things
except the wild sea bird—an antiquated volume on
the Scandinavian mysteries in hand—I give myself
up to solitary reflection.—Dark dreams of superstition!—and
must the order and loveliness of this glorious
world be terminated in one wild wreck—one
chaos of hopeless ruin!—shall all the labors of creative
goodness sink beneath the power of the unchained
demon of destruction!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We move upon the hardened crust of a volcanic
crater!—The solid pillars of the earth have given
way once and again!—The stony relics of a former
world forewarn proud man himself, that he too, with
all his boastful race is hurrying to his doom!—All
things have their cycles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a pitiful guide is the unaided light of human
reason, when it grapples with the mysteries of creation!
The good and great have lived in every land,
and all have striven to elevate the soul of man above
the grovelling passions and desires that link him
with the brutes—pointing his attention to the future,
and instilling a belief in other powers, by whose
high best our destiny is governed, and whose wise
decrees will prove hereafter the reward of virtue
and the scourge of vice.—Yet what have they accomplished!—Each
forms a Deity, whose attributes are
the reflection of the physical objects which surround
him, or the echo of his own ill-regulated feelings!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the bright regions of the East, where the unremitting
ardor of the sun gives birth to an infinity of
life, and the decaying plant or animal is scarce
resolved into its elements, ere other forms start forth
from its remains—<span class='it'>there</span>, the soul of man must wander
from link to link in the great chain of Nature,
till, purified by ages of distress, it merges into the
very essence of the power supreme!—a power divided
and engaged in an eternal contest with itself! a
never-ceasing war between the principles of Good
and Evil!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those distant regions of the North, where winter
rules three-quarters of the year, and the orb of day,
with look askance, but half illuminates man’s dwelling
and his labors—where verdure, for a few days,
clothes the hills with transitory grace; but all that
seeks support from vegetable aliment is endowed
with fleetness like the reindeer, or migrates, in the icy
season, to more genial climes with the wild duck and
the pigeon;—in that gloomy circle, where the frozen
earth scarce yields a foot in depth to all the warming
influence of summer, and men, curtailed of half the
sad resource spared even in the primeval curse,
swept with their robber hordes the provinces of their
more fortunate neighbors until the iron art of war
barred up the avenues to these precious granaries;—in
that inhospitable region where dire necessity
inters the living infant with the departed mother, and
resigns the aged and decrepit to starvation!—the
Parent of Good is a warrior armed, compelled to
struggle fruitlessly with Fate, until, with Thor’s
dread hammer in his hand, he yields, and breathes
his last beneath the arm of liberated Locke!</p>

<p class='pindent'>All! all contention!—Our very nature refuses credence
in annihilation! Then⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is there no place of rest?—no truth in the visions
which haunt us as the sun declines, and the rich hues
of evening fade away—when the spirits of those we
have loved “sit mournfully upon their clouds,” gazing,
with a chastened melancholy which refines but
cannot darken the calm bliss of Paradise, upon the
ceaseless, bootless turmoil of their once cherished
friends? Mythology presents us with no brighter
future than the wild riot of the Hall of Odin, the
lethean inanity of Hades, or the sensual and unmanly
luxury of the Moslem Bowers of the Blest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But hark! A manly voice, speaking of a loftier
philosophy, rises upon the clear air from the very
bowels of the vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the earth,” it cries, “was without form and
void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep:
and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly and in measured cadence poured forth,
from the lips of one who felt the truths he uttered,
the exposition of the order of creation and the high
destinies of the creature. ’Tis a layman’s effort,
clothed in language suited to the rude ideas of simple-minded
men:—I am not of his faith,—and cannot
crowd my thoughts within the narrow compass of
our wooden walls:—aloft in air, my temple is the
canopy of heaven!—my hymn—the wild tone of the
ocean-wind with the low rushing of the billows!—the
symphony of Nature!—yet, as the words of
prayer ascend upon the gale, my own thoughts follow
them.—I know them for the pure aspiration of
the heart,—the breathing of a contrite spirit!—They
are registered above!</p>

<p class='pindent'>All is still!—But, again, the harmony of many
voices strikes the ear. A hymn of praise from the
wide bosom of the southern ocean!—No hearer but
the spirit to whose glory these sweet notes are tuned!
The distance, and the deadening influence of the narrow
hatches, render words inaudible; but, such as
this, their tenor might have been.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY PARK BENJAMIN.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> the last edition of Mrs. Norton’s poems, the
unrivalled burine of Lewis has attempted to trace
the form and lineaments of the authoress—one of
the most perfect specimens of female loveliness that
ever furnished an idea to the painter or inspiration
to the poet. Affliction, which has graven
such deep lines into her heart, has not yet effaced
the beauty of her countenance, or impaired the perfection
of her form. We have, in the engraving before
us, the full maturity of that gorgeous beauty,
which, in its infancy, commanded the unqualified
admiration of the most severe and fastidious critics,
that ever sat in the Court of Fashion. We have
still spared to us, that full and voluptuous bust—the
arm that statuaries delight to chisel, and a neck that
would have crazed Canova, while it rivals in whiteness,
the purest Carrara of his studio. But it is the
more minute and delicate lines of her beauty that have
been swept by the touch of grief. Her countenance
is sad and subdued; her full and flexible lip is no
longer played upon by ever-varying smiles, and her
eye, which once beamed with every expression,
from the twinkle of arch simplicity to the flash of an
insulted Jewess, has now settled into the melting,
mournful, appealing gaze of heart-breaking sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we consider that a form so peerless, is the
dwelling place of a most brilliant and gifted spirit—that
a countenance so winning and expressive is but
the reflex of a pure and exalted soul,—that her
eye is moistened by the swelling fountain beneath—that
lips whose mute beauty is so persuasive, are the
oracles of “thoughts that breathe and of words that
burn,” we can no longer discredit the miracles,
which, in all ages, female loveliness has wrought,
the devotion and the sacrifices it has wrung from the
stern and selfish spirit of man. We are at no loss
for the reason, why the Greeks of old raised altars
to incarnate Beauty, why heroes bent their knees at
her feet, and purchased trophies with their blood
that they might suspend them in her temples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If such endowments melt us into fealty, when, like
the distant stars, they shine above our reach and
our aspirations,—if such a being commands our respectful
yet ardent love, when moving in a sphere
we never can approach, exacting homage from a
thousand hearts, and raised as much above our sympathy
as our position—what strength of affection,
what full, free, unreserved devotion is enlisted in
her service, when she is brought <span class='it'>near</span> to us by sorrow,
when the sympathy of the humblest may be a
balm to the wounded spirit of the highest, when
innocence is assailed in <span class='it'>her</span> form, her character defamed,
her honor maligned, her “life’s life lied
away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be known to most of our readers, that,
incited by the political enemies of Lord Melbourne,
the husband of Mrs. Norton commenced legal proceedings
against that nobleman, alleging at the same
time, the infidelity of his own wife. No means,
which personal hatred or political bigotry could employ,
were left untried, to sustain the accusation,
and the fate of this unfortunate lady became involved
with the triumph or the overthrow of Cabinets. All
the arts, which were so successfully used to blacken
the memory and hurry to an early grave the illustrious
consort of George the Fourth, were revived
against Mrs. Norton. Servants were bribed, spies
were employed, key-holes searched, perjury encouraged,
letters forged, surmises whispered about as
facts, and doubts magnified into certainties, that the
lady might be convicted and the minister crushed.
The whole life, conduct, and conversation of the
victim were subjected to the most searching scrutiny,
her letters and private papers, her diary even—the
communings of an imaginative woman with her
own soul—were placed in the hands of dexterous
and sophistical attorneys, that they might be tortured
into proofs of guilt. Acts which the most rigid
duenna would not have named—indiscretions, the out-gushings
of a heart conscious of its own purity, the
confiding conduct of innocence, and the licentiousness
of her grandfather, were the strong proofs of
adultery which counsel had the impudence to present
to an English Jury. On the testimony of bribed
witnesses, perjured coachmen and lubricious chambermaids,
they sought to impeach the unsullied honor
of a British matron; to fix stain on the pure lawn of
a seraph by evidence which would not have sullied
the flaunting robes of a Cyprian. Need it be said
that the result of such an infamous attempt was the
complete and triumphant vindication of the accused?
But the acquittal of a Jury can be no reparation to
a woman whose honor has been publicly assailed.
Female virtue must not only be above reproach, but
beyond suspicion, and the breath of calumny is frequently
as fatal to it as the decrees of truth. The
verdict of “not guilty,” is no bar to the malignity of
scandal-loving human nature; there remain the cavil,
the sneer, the “damning doubt,” the insolent jest.
She is separated by an impassable gulf from her only
lawful protector; she can fly to no other without
shame; she is placed in the most ambiguous position
in society—that of an <span class='it'>unmarried</span> wife; fettered by
all the restraints, watched with all the jealousy, but
entitled to none of the privileges of the conjugal tie.
And, in addition to all this, she becomes a bereaved
mother; for the “righteous law entrusts the children
to the exclusive guardianship of the father.” Such
is the position which a combination of most untoward
circumstances has forced upon a lady who has
every claim upon the protection, the respect, the
admiration and the love of mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have dwelt thus long upon the domestic infelicity
of Mrs. Norton, for the purpose of illustrating
the influence which it has had in modifying her
genius, and accounting for the undercurrent of deep
melancholy which is discernible in many of her
pieces, and for the outbreaks of passionate sympathy
with the peculiar sorrows and sufferings of her own
sex, which distinguish all of her more recent productions.
Not alone, however, is Mrs. Norton in
her misfortunes. She is but one of a large sisterhood,
who, finding the waters poisoned that rill from
“affection’s springs,” have sought to relieve their
thirst from the “charmed cup” of Fame, who, in
the deep and bitter fountains of unrequited love, in
the gulfs of their own woe, have gathered pearls to
deck the brow of female genius. The mournful song
of Hemans, of Tighe and of Landon, had scarcely died
away, before the lips of a fourth were touched with
live coals from the same furnace of affliction. Indeed,
domestic infelicity is so often connected with
the developement of the poetical faculty in woman,
is so frequently the cause which first awakens
those deep and vivid emotions which are the essence
of poetry, is so universally the concomitant and the
burthen of female song, that the relation between
the two is well worthy of philosophic investigation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems to us that the effect is a very manifest result
of the cause. The female mind is distinguished
from that of the sterner sex, by its more delicate organization,
by its keener sensibility, by its stronger
and more sensitive affections; by its inferiority in
mere strength of intellect, clearness of understanding,
and range of observation. Her vision, therefore,
though nicer, more accurate and susceptible, within
its own range, takes in but a very small portion of
that poetic realm which stretches from “heaven to
earth, and from earth to heaven.” She is consequently
more entirely introversive than man, and
draws whatever she communicates more from within
than from without. She does not derive her inspiration,
she does not form her genius, from a wide and
accurate survey of human passions. The emotions
which gave birth to such creations as Satan, Prometheus,
Shylock, Manfred; the frightful visions which
glare from the lurid page of Dante’s Inferno; the
wide range of incident, description and passion which
distinguish the poetry of Scott and Southey—it would
be unnatural and unreasonable to expect from the
delicate and peace-loving nature of woman. Her
heart could never “bide the beatings” of such storms.
She can, at the most, but love ardently, hope lastingly,
and endure faithfully; and when she sings she
can be but the oracle of her own heart. When her
hopes are baffled, when her household gods are scattered,
when despair takes up its abode within her
breast these emotions become vocal, and she sings
of yearning love, of deathless affections, of unshaken
constancy, of patient endurance, of self-sacrificing
devotion. As by the law of her nature, so by her
position in society, the cultivation of her affections
must be by far the most prominent object of her life,
as well as her most reliable source for enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In man’s life love is but an episode; in woman’s it
is the entire action of the piece. With him it is but
one act in the drama, with her it is the beginning,
middle, and end. Man’s warfare with the world is
like the battle array of the Romans—they had their
first, second, and third rank. If the first was defeated
it fell back into the intervals of the second, and
both together renewed the attack; if vanquished
again they were received into the wider intervals of
the third, and the whole mass united made a more
impetuous onset. Thus with man, if unsuccessful
in Love he rallies on Ambition; if again defeated, he
falls back with accumulated energy upon Avarice—the
peculiar passion of old age. Not so with woman;
upon her success as a wife and a mother, her whole
happiness is risked. In her encounter with the world
she has no passion in reserve; she concentrates her
whole force into one line and trusts herself and her
fortune upon the success of a single charge. If unfortunate
in this venture, she has no place for retreat
except the recesses of her own heart. Can we wonder,
then, that disappointment in what she values the
most, the utter blight of her hopes, affections driven
back upon her heart, and trust betrayed, should excite
those strong and fervent emotions which will not
“down” at mortal bidding, but express themselves
in song? or, that the wing of her spirit while brooding
over the ruin of her peace, should gather strength
for poetic flight?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not know where we could have found a
more complete illustration of these views than in
the history of Mrs. Norton. The blow which blighted
the fair promise of her spring, found her a poetess
of some celebrity. She had given to the world
many pieces, imbued with the warm sensibility,
the pure, ardent, and devoted love of woman; but
nothing which in sincerity, strength, fervor and truthfulness
of passion, can compare with the “Dream”—gushing
as it does from the heart of the betrayed wife
and abandoned mother. We had intended to speak
at some length of the characteristics of Mrs. Norton’s
genius, but we believe that the same end will be accomplished
more to the edification of our readers,
by giving a short analysis of this beautiful poem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of the piece, is brief and simple, and was
undoubtedly suggested to her mind by the association
of contrast. We are presented with a widowed
mother watching</p>

<p class='pindent'>If such a quantity of poetry and such poetry—Spencer,
Milton, Dryden, Cowper, Shakspeare,
Dante, Tasso and Göethe did not enlighten the
“young innocent,” respecting the emotions with
which she regarded the “fond companion of her
dreams,” we do not know to whom to commend her
for instruction. But we must hurry on with the
story; the pair wander over Italy, and a picture is
presented, of mountain and vale, of orange and myrtle
groves, of grottoes, fountains, palaces, paintings,
and statues that would “create a soul” under the
ribs of a utilitarian. We were inclined to think that
he of “the most noble brow,” entrapped the young
affections of the dreamer in the “old library,” but
we do not believe that she breathed the delicious
confession into his ear until they reached the sunny
clime of Italy. It was the unrivalled music of that
land which unsealed her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I bade farewell to my native land, Mildred,
I left you surrounded by a wide circle of admirers;
you were beautiful and rich,—these gifts
alone would have won you many a suitor,—but you
were also possessed of the noblest qualities of heart
and mind, and were as worthy to be loved as to be
admired. How has it happened then that from
among the many who sought your hand, you selected
one so—so⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand you, Emily,—so misshapen and ugly,
you would say; it is precisely because I possessed a
little more heart and soul than usually belongs to a
fashionable belle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Mildred? when I parted from

the handsome Frank Harcourt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you return to find me married to his crooked

<p class='pindent'>“I did not know Mr. Heyward was related to your
quondam admirer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I see I must tell the whole story; ‘wooed
an’ married an’ a’ ’ is not enough for you; I must
relate all the particulars which led to such an apparently
whimsical choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember me doubtless as the <span class='it'>enfant gâtée</span>
of society; the spoiled child of doating parents, and
the flattered votary of fashion. My web of life, unbroken
by a single sombre thread, seemed woven
only of rose-color and gold. My mirror taught me
that the world spoke truth, when it assigned to me
the brightest of all womanly gifts: experience showed
me my superiority in mind over the well dressed
dolls of society: and the earnestness of my affection
for the friends of my youth, convinced me that many
stronger and deeper emotions still lay latent within
my heart. Yet with all these gifts, Emily, I narrowly
escaped the fate of a fashionable flirt. I could not
complain, like Voltaire, that ‘the world was stifling
me with roses,’ but I might have truly said, that the
incense offered at the shrine of my vanity was fast
defacing, with its fragrant smoke, the fine gold that
adorned the idol. Selfishness is a weed which flourishes
far more luxuriantly beneath the sunshine of
prosperity than under the weeping skies of adversity;
for, while sorrow imparts a fellow-feeling with all
who suffer, happiness too often engenders habits of
indulgence, utterly incompatible with sympathy and
disinterestedness. Wherever I turned I was met by
pleasant looks and honied words, everybody seemed
to consider me with favor, and I was in great danger
of believing that the world was all sincerity and Miss
Mildred all perfection. The idea that I shone in the
reflected glitter of my father’s gold never occurred
to me. Too much accustomed to the appliances of
wealth to bestow a thought upon them; entirely ignorant
of the want and consequently of the value of
money, I could not suppose that other people prized
what to me was a matter of such perfect indifference,
or that the weight of my purse gave me any undue
preponderance in the scale of society. Proud, haughty
and self-willed as I have been, yet my conscience
acquits me of ever having valued myself upon the
adventitious advantages of wealth. Had I been born
in a hovel I still should have been proud:—proud of
the capabilities of my own character,—proud because
I understood and appreciated the dignity of
human nature,—but I should have despised myself if,
from the slippery eminence of fortune, I could have
looked with contempt upon my fellow beings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I was spoiled, Emily, completely spoiled.
There was so much temptation around me,—so
much opportunity for exaction and despotism that
my moral strength was not sufficient to resist the
impulses of wrong. With my head full of romantic
whims, and my heart thrilling with vague dreams of
devoted love and life-long constancy; a brain teeming
with images of paladin and troubadour, and a
bosom throbbing with vain longings for the untasted
joy of reciprocal affection,—I yet condescended to
play the part of a consummate coquette. But, no; if by
coquetry be meant a deliberate system of machinations
to entrap hearts which become worthless as
soon as gained, then I never was a coquette, but I certainly
must plead guilty to the charge of thoughtless,
aimless, mischievous flirtation. If the Court of Love
still existed,—that court, which, as you know, was
instituted in the later days of chivalry, and composed
of an equal number of knights and dames, whose duty
it was to try all criminals accused of offences against
the laws of Love; if such a tribunal still existed, I
think it might render a verdict of <span class='it'>wilful murder</span>
against a <span class='it'>coquette</span>, while only <span class='it'>manslaughter</span> could be
laid to the charge of the <span class='it'>flirt</span>. The result of both
cases is equally fatal, but the latter crime is less in
degree because it involves no <span class='it'>malice prepense</span>. Do
not misunderstand me, Emily, I do not mean to exculpate
the lesser criminal; for if the one deserves
capital punishment the other certainly merits imprisonment
for life, and, next to the slanderer, I look
upon the coquette and habitual flirt as the most dangerous
characters in society. Yet I believe that
many a woman is imperceptibly led to the very verge
of flirtation by a natural and even praiseworthy desire
to please. The fear of giving pain when we
suspect we possess the power, often gives softness to
a woman’s voice and sweetness to her manner,
which, to the heart of a lover, may bear a gentler
interpretation. Among the chief of our minor duties
may be ranked that of making ourselves agreeable;
and who does not know the difficulty of walking
between two lines without crossing either? You
think I am saying all this in exculpation of my past
folly, and perhaps you are right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just nineteen, and in the full enjoyment of
my triumphs in society, when I officiated as your
bridesmaid. I must confess, Emily, that the marriage
of such a pretty, delicate creature, as you then
were, with a man full twice your age, in whose dark
whiskers glistened more than one silver thread, and
on whom time had already bestowed a most <span class='it'>visible
crown</span>, seemed to me one of the marvels of affection
for which I could not then account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you are taking your revenge, Mildred, for
my saucy question respecting your husband; but if
you can give as good a reason for your choice as I
found for mine, I shall be perfectly satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me gratify my merry malice, ladye fair;
time has shown some little consideration for you in
this matter, for, while he has left no deeper impress
on your husband’s brow, he has expanded the slender
girl into the blooming, matronly-looking woman.
You are now well matched, Emily, and your husband
is one of the handsomest men of—<span class='it'>his age</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arch look of the speaker interpreted the
equivocally-worded compliment, and, with a joyous
laugh, <a id='mrs2'></a>Mrs. Heyward resumed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was about the time of your marriage, and
shortly before your departure for Europe, that I became
acquainted with Frank Harcourt. You must
remember his exceeding beauty. The first time I
beheld him, Byron’s exquisite description of the
Apollo Belvedere rose to my lips:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>——“In his delicate form,—a dream of Love</p>
<p class='line0'>Shaped by some solitary nymph, whose heart</p>
<p class='line0'>Longed for a deathless lover from above</p>
<p class='line0'>And maddened in that vision, is exprest</p>
<p class='line0'>All that ideal beauty ever blessed</p>
<p class='line0'>The mind with in its most unearthly mood.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>His admirable symmetry of form, and a face of such
perfect contour, such exquisite regularity of feature,
that its semblance in marble might have been valued
as a relic of Grecian ideal beauty, were alone sufficient
to attract the admiration of such a lover of the
beautiful as I always have been; but the charm of
perfect coloring, the effect of light and shade was
not wanting in this finished picture. His full dark
eye sparkled beneath a snow-white forehead,—his
cheek was bronzed by exposure and yet bright with
health,—his lips were crimson and velvet-like as the
pomegranate flower,—his teeth white as the ocean
pearl,—his raven curls fell in those rich slight tendrils
so rarely seen except on the head of infancy,—while
the soft and delicate shadowing in his lip and
chin resembled rather the silken texture of a lady’s
eyebrow, than the wiry and matted masses of hair
usually cherished under the name of whiskers and
moustache.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are quite impassioned in your description,
Mildred; what would your husband say if he were
to hear you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would agree with me in thinking that Frank
Harcourt is the most beautiful specimen of humanity
that ever presented itself to my admiring eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has less jealousy then in his nature than most
of his sex.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man has little cause to be jealous of a rival he
has so utterly discomfited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harcourt soon professed himself my admirer and
need I say that his attentions were by no means displeasing
to me. The buzz of admiration which met my
ear whenever he appeared,—the delight with which
ladies accepted his slightest civilities,—the manœuvres
constantly practised to secure his society, all
tended to render me vain of his homage. Had he
been merely a beautiful statue,—a rich but empty casket,
I should soon have become weary of my conquest.
But Harcourt possessed a mind rather above mediocrity,
fine taste, elegant manners, and, what was
especially useful to him, great skill in decyphering
character and consummate tact in adapting himself to
its various peculiarities. When those beautiful lips
parted only to utter the language of high-toned sentiment,
or to breathe the impassioned words of Byron
and Moore,—when those bright eyes glistened with
suppressed tears at the voice of melancholy music,
or sparkled with merry delight at the tones of gayety;
when that fine person swayed itself with inimitable
grace to the movements of the mazy dance, or bent
its towering altitude with gentle dignity over the
slight form of some delicate girl, it is not strange,
that, even to my eyes, he should seem all that was
noble and majestic in mind as well as person. Flattered
by his courtly attentions, congratulated by my
fashionable friends, and captivated by his brilliant
qualities, my imagination soon became excited to a
degree which bore a strong semblance to affection.
He offered me his hand and was accepted. You look
surprised, Emily; I thought you knew that I was
actually engaged to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I did not, Mildred, and I regret now to
learn that such was the case. There is something
to me very wrong,—I might almost say <span class='it'>disgraceful</span>
in the disruption of such bonds; and the levity with
which young ladies now <span class='it'>make</span> and <span class='it'>break</span> engagements,
argues as ill for the morality of society, as does
the frequency of bankruptcies and suspensions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you, Emily, and since it has become
the fashion to consider the most solemn obligations
only as a strait-laced garment which may be
thrown off as soon as we can shut out society from
our solitude,—since women pledge their hands without
even knowing whether they have such an article
as a <span class='it'>heart</span> to accompany it,—since men with equal
ease <span class='it'>repudiate</span> their debts and their wives, I am
afraid the next generation has little chance of learning
morality from their parents. But sometimes,
Emily, the sin is in <span class='it'>making</span> not in <span class='it'>breaking</span> the engagement.
However, hear my story, and then judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the world knew that I was affianced to the
handsome Frank Harcourt, and I was quite willing
to enjoy my triumph as long as possible, before I settled
myself down to the dull routine of domestic life.
This disposition to defer my marriage might have led
me to suspect the nature of my feelings, for no woman
will ever shrink from a union with one to whom
her soul is knit in the close bonds of affection. My
lover was respectably connected, but had been educated
for no profession and was not possessed of
fortune. He had left his native village to find employment,
and, as he hoped, wealth, in the busy mart
of the Empire state. How he managed to satisfy
my father, who, in the true spirit of an old Dutch
burgomaster, looked upon every man as a rogue if
he did not possess some visible occupation, I never
could discover. He probably flattered his self-love
by listening to all his schemes for the reformation of
society; and, I am not sure that he did not draw up
the constitution and by-laws of a certain association
which my father wished to establish,—to be entitled
a “Society for the Encouragement of Integrity
among men of Business,” and of which the old gentleman
meant to constitute himself president.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was agreed that our marriage should take place
at the expiration of a year, and my father (who was
as fond of coincidents as a newspaper editor) declared
that on the very day of our nuptials, the name
of Harcourt should be added to the very respectable
firm of Marchmont, Goodfellow &amp; Co. About this
part of the arrangement I cared very little. I enjoyed
the present moment, and lavished my time, my
thoughts and my feelings as foolishly as I did the
gold with which my father supplied me. I was a
mere child in my knowledge of the duties of life, and
perhaps there never was one of my age to whom the
word ‘<span class='it'>responsibility</span>’ was so mystical a sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I soon discovered that I had a serious rival in the
affections of my future husband. Frank Harcourt
loved himself far better than he did his mistress;
and though his tact enabled him to avoid any offensive
expression of this Narcissus-like preference, it
was still very perceptible to me. Yet how could I
blame him when I looked upon his handsome person?
Indeed I often found myself quoting Pope’s celebrated
couplet, but with a difference,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“If to his share a coxcomb’s errors fall,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Look in his face and you forget them all.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>The truth was, that my vanity induced me to excuse
his weakness. I was proud of exhibiting, as my
lover, the man whom all admired; and I felt redoubled
satisfaction in hearing him applauded by the very
people who had already bestowed on me the meed of
praise. I was even so foolish as to be vain of his
costume, and although I knew that he wasted hours
upon the adornment of his person, I delighted to see
him appear attired in that manner, so peculiarly his
own, which gave a graceful negligence to a toilet the
most <span class='it'>soignée</span> and made a fanciful poet once style his
dress ‘<span class='it'>an elegant impromptu</span>.’ Like some other
(so-called) impromptus, many a weary hour had been
bestowed upon the task of making it <span class='it'>seem</span> extemporaneous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only one of Frank Harcourt’s family with
whom I then became acquainted, was his cousin
Louis Heyward, and, among the whole circle of my
acquaintances, there was no one whom I so cordially
disliked. His form was diminutive and slightly misshapen,
while his face would have been positively
ugly, but for the effect of a pair of large, dark, soft eyes
which seemed to speak a more fluent language than
his lips. His manners were cold, quiet and indifferent;
he mingled but little in society, and I think our
well-filled library and my music alone induced him to
conquer his reserve sufficiently to become one of my
habitual visiters. To me he was always polite and
gentlemanly but no more. He never flattered,—never
even commended, though he often looked as if he
would have censured, had he felt himself privileged
to do so. Frank used to take great pains to bring
him out into company, (Heaven forgive me if I
wrong him in believing <span class='it'>now</span> that he wanted him as
a foil to his own exceeding beauty,) but, excepting
at our house, Louis was rarely seen in society. He
had devoted himself to the gospel ministry, and, in
order to support himself independently during the
period of his theological studies, he had engaged to
give instructions in some of the higher branches of
education, at one of our principal schools. In fact
Louis Heyward was only a poor student, a school-master,—yet
he dared to criticise the conduct of the
flattered and spoiled Mildred Marchmont; and he
alone,—of all the gifted and the graceful who bowed
before her power,—he alone—the deformed, the unlovely—seemed
to despise her influence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray how did you discover that he was actuated
by such feelings? he surely did not venture to disclose
them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Emily; he was usually silent and abstracted
in my presence. His relationship to Frank, placed
him at once on a familiar footing in our family, and,
we soon became accustomed to his somewhat eccentric
manners. When not listening to my harp or
piano, he was often occupied with a book, seeming
utterly regardless of every one around him. But,
often, when I have been sitting in the midst of an
admiring circle of ‘danglers’ bestowing on one a
smile, on another a sweet word, on another a trifling
command, and, in short, playing off the thousand
petty airs which belles are very apt to practise in order
to claim the attentions of all around them,—I
have stolen a glance at that cold, grave countenance,
and there has been such severe expression in his
speaking eyes,—such a smile of contempt on his pale
lip, that I have blushed for my own folly even while
I hated the cynic who made me sensible of it. I was
constantly disputing with him about trifling matters
of opinion, and I delighted in uttering beautiful fallacies,
which I knew he would contradict. It was a
species of gladiatorial game which I enjoyed because
it was new and exciting. I had been so long accustomed
to assent and flattery that it was quite refreshing
to meet with something like opposition, which
could arouse the dormant powers of my mind. The
information with which my early reading had stored
my memory,—the quickness of repartee which generally
belongs to woman,—the readiness to turn the
weapon of the assailant with a shield for our own
weakness which is so very <span class='it'>feminine</span> a mode of argument,—all
afforded a new gratification to my vanity,
and while I heartily disliked the disputant, I yet
eagerly sought the dispute. Louis at length discovered
my motives for thus seeking to draw him into
discussions, and, after that, no provocation could induce
him to enter into a war of wit with me. In
vain I uttered the most mischievous sophistries,—in
vain I goaded him with keen satire; he smiled at my
futile attempts, as if I were a petted child, but deigned
me no reply. It was not until then that I estimated
the treasures of his gifted mind, for when he no longer
allowed himself to be drawn from his reserve,—when
his fine conversational powers were no longer exerted,
I felt I had lost a positive enjoyment which when
in my possession I had scarcely thought of valuing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I happened one afternoon to be walking on the
Battery with the two cousins, when we overtook an
acquaintance who was unattended, except by a young
brother. We immediately joined her, and, with a
feeling of gratified vanity, (knowing that she had
once diligently sought to attract Mr. Harcourt,) I
stepped back, and taking the arm of Louis, left the
lady in uninterrupted possession, <span class='it'>for a short time</span>, of
my handsome lover. There was a mean and petty
triumph in my heart at which I now blush, and, as I
looked up into the face of my companion, after performing
the manœuvre, I was almost startled at the
stern contempt which was visible in his countenance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Come, Mr. Heyward, do make yourself agreeable
for once,’ I exclaimed, with levity, ‘do tell me you
are flattered by my preference of your society.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I never utter untruths,’ was the cold reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My first impulse was to withdraw my arm from
his, but I restrained myself, and flippantly said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You are as complimentary as usual, I perceive.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Would you have me to feel flattered by being
made the tool of your vanity, Madam?’ said he,
while his cheek flushed and his eye sparkled; ‘do
I not know that you only sought to gratify a malicious
triumph over your less fortunate rival?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A denial rose to my lips, but my conscience forbade
me to utter it. I was perfectly silent—yet,
perhaps, there was something of penitence in my
countenance, for he immediately added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Good Heavens! Mildred,—Miss Marchmont, I
mean—what capabilities of mind,—what noble characteristics
of feeling you are daily wasting in
society! How rapidly are the weeds of evil passion
springing up amid the rich plants of virtue which
are still rooted in your heart! How awful is the
responsibility of one so nobly gifted as yourself!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What do you mean, sir?’ exclaimed I, startled
at his earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Have you never read the parable of the unfaithful
steward who hid his talent in the earth?’ was
his reply: ‘God has given you beauty and mental
power, and wealth and influence; yet what is your
beauty but a snare?—What are your talents but
instruments to gratify your vanity? Where is your
wealth expended if not in ministering to your luxuries?
What suffering fellow-being has ever been
cheered by your sympathy?—or what weak and erring
mortal has ever been strengthened in duty, or
wakened to virtue by your influence?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot describe how deeply I was shocked and
pained at these impressive words. An emotion resembling
terror seized me;—I was actually alarmed
at the picture they abruptly presented to my view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Louis continued: ‘Forgive me, Miss Marchmont,
if I have trespassed beyond the limits of decorum. I
speak the language of <span class='it'>truth</span>,—a language you are
but little accustomed to hear; but my conscience
and my heart have long reproached my silence.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You are a severe judge, Mr. Heyward,’ said I,
with a faint attempt at a smile; and just at that moment
we were interrupted by some jesting remarks
from the party who preceded us. No opportunity was
afforded for renewing our conversation; but as we
approached home, Louis lingered so as to secure a
moment’s time, and said in a low voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I will not ask you to forgive my frankness, Miss
Marchmont, for something tells me that the time will
come when you will not resent my apparent rudeness.
I owe to you some of the happiest, and, it
may be, some of the saddest moments of my life.
Before we part, I would fain awaken you to a sense
of your own true value, for amid all the frivolities
which now waste your life, I have discovered that
<span class='it'>you were born for better things</span>.’ As he uttered these
words, we found ourselves at my father’s door, and
with a cold bow he turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That night I was engaged to attend a brilliant ball,
but my spirits were depressed, and my brow clouded
by unwonted sadness. Whether wheeling in the
giddy dance, or gliding with light words and lighter
laugh amid the groups of pleasure-seeking guests,
still the deep voice of Louis Heyward rung in my
ears; and the words ‘<span class='it'>you were born for better
things</span>,’ seemed written upon everything that I
beheld.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You are <span class='it'>triste</span> to-night, <span class='it'>ma belle</span>,’ said Frank
Harcourt, as he placed me in the carriage to return
home: ‘I shall be quite jealous of my crooked
cousin, if a <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span> with him has such power to
dim your radiance.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many a truth is uttered in the language of mockery.
That walk with Louis had become an era in my
life. How I longed to weep in solitude! The weariness
and satiety which had long unconsciously possessed
me,—the unsatisfied cravings for excitement, which
had long been my torment, now seemed to me fully
explained. Louis Heyward had unfolded to me the
truth,—he had revealed the secret of my hidden discontent,
when he told me <span class='it'>I was born for better things</span>.
I had ‘<span class='it'>placed my happiness lower than myself</span>,’ and
therefore did I gather only disappointment and vexation.
Why did I not utter these thoughts to my
affianced lover? Why did I not weep upon his
bosom and seek his tender sympathy? Because I
instinctively knew that he would not understand me.
The charm which enrobed my idol was already unwinding,
and I had learned that there were many
subjects on which there could exist no congenial
sentiments. For the first time in my life, I began to
reflect; and, with reflection, came remorse for
wasted time and ill-regulated feelings. Like the
peasant girl in the fairy tale, mine eyes had been
touched with the ointment of disenchantment, the
illusion which had made life seem a scene of perfect
beauty and happiness was dispelled forever,
and I now only beheld a field where thorns grew
beneath every flower, and a path where duties were
strewn far more thickly than pleasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A circumstance which soon after occurred confirmed
my melancholy impressions. Do you remember
little Fanny Rivers whom my mother took while yet a
child, with the intention of making her my confidential
servant and dressing-maid? She was about my
age, and had grown up to be very pretty,—with one
of those sweet, innocent, child-like faces, which are
always so lovely in woman. Soon after your marriage
she abruptly left my service, and much to my
regret I was unable to obtain any trace of her. At
the time of which I have just spoken, however, I
received a note from her. She was sick and in distress,
and she requested from me some pecuniary
aid. I did not receive the appeal with indifference,
and instead of merely sending her assistance I determined
to seek her in person. I found her residing
with a relative, a poor washerwoman, and as I sat
by the sick bed of the young invalid, I for the first
time beheld, with my own eyes, the actual life of
poverty. Hitherto I had been lavish of money in
charity, from a thoughtless and selfish wish to avoid
the sight of suffering, but now I learned to sympathise
with the poor and unhappy. Poor Fanny was
dying with consumption, and daily did I visit her
humble apartment, led thither as much by my morbid
and excited feelings as by my interest in the failing
sufferer. But it was not till she was near her death-hour
that she revealed to me her painful story. Never
shall I forget her simple words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I used to think ma’m, that nothing was so
desirable as fine clothes, and when I saw you dressed
in your beautiful silks and satins, I used to cry with
envy because I was only a servant. As I grew older
this wicked feeling increased, and often when you
had gone to a party, I have locked myself in your
dressing-room, and put on your laces, and flowers
and jewels, just to see how I should look in such
fine dress. I felt very proud when the large glass
showed me that I looked just like a lady; but it only
made me more envious and unhappy. At last my
hour of temptation came. One,—whose name I
have sworn never to reveal,—came to me with promises
of all that I had so long wanted. He offered
me silk dresses, and plenty of money, and said I
should have servants to wait on me if I would only
love him. He was so handsome, and he brought me
such costly presents,—he talked to me so sweetly
and pitied me so much for being a servant when I
ought to be a lady, that I could not refuse to believe
him. He told me I should be his wife in the sight of
Heaven, and he ridiculed what he called my old-fashioned
notions, until he made me forget the prayers
which my poor mother taught me and the Bible
which she used to read to me. I was vain and so I
became wicked. I sold my happiness on earth and
my hopes of Heaven hereafter, for the privilege of
wearing fine clothes; for indeed, Miss Mildred, I
never was happy after I left your house.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sought to learn no more of poor Fanny’s history,
Emily; I scarcely heard the tale of her subsequent
desertion and destitution. My conscience was
awakened, and fearfully did she knell in my ears my
own condemnation. ‘Who made ye to differ?’ asked
my heart, as I gazed on this victim to vanity and
treachery. Who taught this fallen creature to value
the allurements of dress beyond the adornment of
innocence? Who sowed in her bosom the seeds of
envy and discontent, and nurtured them there until
they bore the poisoned fruit of sin? Was I guiltless
of my brother’s blood? Had not I been the <span class='it'>first</span>
tempter of the guileless child? Here, then, was an
evidence of my influence;—how fatally exercised!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emily, I have repented in tears and agony of
spirit:—I have prayed that this weight of blood-guiltiness
might be removed from my soul; and I
humbly trust my prayer has not been in vain:—but
even now my heart sickens at the recollection of the
being whom my example first led astray. It was at
the bedside of the dying girl,—when my spirit was
bowed in humble penitence—that the words of religious
truth first impressed themselves upon my adamantine
heart. I had listened unmoved to the promises
and denunciations of the gospel, when uttered
from the pulpit; but now, the time, the place, the
circumstance gave them tenfold power. I visited
Fanny Rivers daily, until death released the penitent
from her sufferings, and then, I fell into a deep
melancholy from which nothing could arouse me,
and for which no one could account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frank Harcourt was annoyed and vexed at this
change. He earnestly pressed our immediate marriage,
and talked about a trip to Paris as an infallible
cure for my ‘<span class='it'>nervous excitement</span>.’ But in proportion
as my better feelings were awakened, my attachment
to him decreased, until I actually shrunk from
a union with him. He now appeared to me frivolous
in his tastes, and the light tone with which he spoke
of moral duties, though often listened to as an idle
jest, in calmer times, now offended and disgusted
me. In vain I tried to recall my past feelings. In
vain I gazed upon his exquisite face and watched
the movements of his graceful form, in the hope of
again experiencing the thrill of pleasure which had
once been awakened by his presence. The flame
had been kindled at the unholy shrine of vanity, and
already the ashes of perished fancies had gathered
over it to dim its brightness. I could no longer cheat
myself into the belief that I loved Frank Harcourt.
He was still as glorious in beauty,—still the
idol of society; but the spell was broken, and I looked
back with wonder to my past delusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will ask where, during all these changes,
was Louis Heyward. The very day after the conversation
which had so awakened my remorse of
conscience, he bade me farewell, having been summoned
to take charge of a small congregation, and
to ‘build up a church in the wilderness.’ I would
have given much for his counsel and his sympathy,
but he was far away, absorbed in noble duties, and
had probably ceased to remember with interest, the
being whom his <span class='it'>one true word</span> had rescued from
destruction. I was exceedingly wretched, and saw
no escape from my unhappiness. The approach of
the period fixed upon for my marriage only added to
the horror of my feelings, and I sometimes fancied
I should be driven to madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the <span class='it'>dénouement</span>,—a most unexpected one—came
at length. The aunt of poor Fanny, who was
very grateful for my attentions to the unhappy girl,
accidentally heard that I was on the point of marriage
with Mr. Harcourt, and, instigated no less by
revenge than by a sense of gratitude to me, she
revealed to me the <span class='it'>name</span> which Fanny had <span class='it'>sworn</span>,
and she had <span class='it'>promised</span> to conceal. You can imagine
the rest, Emily. With the indignant feeling of insulted
virtue and outraged womanhood, I instantly severed
the tie that bound me to him. Did I not do right in
breaking my engagement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than two years passed away. I had withdrawn
from the follies, though not from the rational
enjoyments of society; and, having joined myself
to the church, I endeavored to live in a manner
worthy of my profession. Alas! all my good deeds
were insufficient to make amends for my wasted
years and baleful example. The world ceased, at
last, to wonder and ridicule my sudden reformation,
(which they kindly attributed to my lover’s fickleness,)
and I was beginning to enjoy the peace of
mind, always attendant on the exercise of habitual
duty, when I was surprised by the intelligence that
Louis Heyward had been chosen to succeed the
deceased pastor of our church. The day when he
preached his first sermon for us will long live in my
remembrance. Associated, as he was, with my
brightest and my darkest hours, I almost feared to
see him, lest the calm of my feelings should be disturbed
by painful recollections. But he now appeared
before me in a new and holier light. He was
a minister of truth unto the people, and as I watched
the rich glow of enthusiasm mantling his pale cheek,
and the pure light of zeal illumining his dark eyes,
I thought there was indeed ‘a beauty in holiness.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not think I was in love with our young pastor.
I fancied that my heart was dead to such impressions,
and it was only with quiet friendship that I greeted
him when he renewed his acquaintance with her
whom he had once known as the glittering belle
of a ball-room. I saw him frequently, for I now understood
the value of wealth and influence when they
could be made subservient to the interests of religion
and humanity. My purse as well as my time was
readily bestowed for the good of others. Always in
extremes, I was in danger of running into the error
of fanaticism, and I owe it to Louis that I am now a
rational, and I trust, earnest Christian. But a long
time elapsed after this renewal of our intercourse
before I was permitted to read the volume of his
heart. It was not until he was well assured that the
change which he beheld was the result, not of temporary
disgust with the world, but of a thorough
conviction of error, that he ventured to indulge the
affections of his nature. He had loved me, Emily,
during my days of vanity and folly. His cold, stern
manner was a penance imposed upon himself,
to expiate his weakness, and while he strove to
scorn my levity, he was, in fact, the slave of my
caprice. But he crushed the passion even in its bud,
and forced himself to regard me only as his cousin’s
bride. Yet the glimpses of better feelings which
sometimes struggled through every frivolity, almost
overcame his resolution, and the conversation which
first awakened me to reflection, was the result of a
sense of duty strangely blended with the impulses
of a hopeless passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfect confidence now existed between us. My
external life had been almost an unbroken calm, but
my heart’s history was one of change and tumult
and darkness. Louis wept,—aye, wept with joy,
when he learned that his hand had sown the good
seed within my bosom. It is Madame de Stäel who
says that ‘Truth, no matter by what atmosphere it
is surrounded, is never uttered in vain;’ and I am
a living proof that she is right. I have now been
five years a wife; and, though my husband has not
a face that limners love to paint and ladies to look
upon,—though his form is not moulded to perfect
symmetry, and his limbs lack the graceful comeliness
of manly strength,—in short,—though he is a <span class='it'>little,
ugly, lame man</span>, yet I look upon him with a love as
deep as it is enduring, for the radiant beauty of his
character has blinded my feeble eyes to mere personal
defects. Frank Harcourt was the sculptured
image,—the useless ornament of a boudoir, but
Louis,—my own Louis is the unpolished casket,—rude
in its exterior, but enclosing a pearl of price,—the
treasure of a noble spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what has become of your former lover?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is the ornament of Parisian saloons; living
no one knows how, but suspected to be one of that
class, termed in England, ‘<span class='it'>flat-catchers</span>,’ lending the
aid of his fine person and fascinating manners to
attract victims to the gaming-table. He is said to be
as handsome as ever,—dresses well, and is the admiration
of all the young ladies as well as the dread
of all the mammas who are on the watch to avoid
‘<span class='it'>ineligibles</span>.’ And now that you have heard my
story, Emily, are you still surprised at my choice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>So then</span>, Julius, you are at last a lawyer, out and
out?—how did you pass your examination?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just to please myself, uncle, I wasn’t stumped
once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo! I am glad to hear it; that was exactly
following my example. Before I got through, they
tried hard to pose me, but I was an overmatch for
them. I would have made a capital lawyer, Julius,
had I chosen to practise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity you did not, uncle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s what all my friends say, and that, if I
had not been too rich to need it, they would have
given me all the business in their power,—every
cent’s worth of it. Many of them wish that I had
been poorer, that I might have been of greater service
to the public.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind friends you must have, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You rascal! I see that you are laughing at me.
However, I intend to take you for my raw material,
and make of you everything that I have failed to be
myself. In the first place, you are to rise to the
height of the profession here, in this very city, to
make amends for my not having attained the station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the opposite reason to yours will forbid my
accomplishing that, my dear sir,—too light a purse,
is, in the generality of cases, a greater obstacle than
one too heavy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An ingenious lawyer, to presume that, when I
employ you to do my work for me, I expect you to
go upon your own means! why, my worshipful attorney,
you must live here with me, in my own house,
and make use of my own purse. It is my place to
pay the expenses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear uncle! how kind you are! how generous!—I
can never be sufficiently grateful⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spare your eloquence to plead my causes for me!—we
lawyers know how much speeches ought to go
for, so I want none of them here, just now. Am I
not telling you that you are to work for me in return?—and
I wish you to fulfil another of my duties towards
society.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything in the world, uncle, after all the kindness⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poh! it’s not any uncommon task I wish you
to undertake. It is only to marry a wife and to raise
a family. You may imitate me in everything but in
being an idler, and an old bachelor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, everybody thinks you, sir, the happiest,
most independent, most contented old bachelor in the
world. Quite an enviable person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not at all to be envied, Julius. As to being
happy,—that’s all a sham. I have never been contented
since they called me an old bachelor. No,
no,—you must have a wife. I have picked one out
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! pray who is she, uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the loveliest girls in the city,—your
cousin Henrietta Attwood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Etty Attwood! the pretty little second-cousin
who used to come sometimes to visit us when I was
a boy! I remember her well;—the most beautiful,
sweetest tempered child in the world; with bright
brown eyes, and flaxen ringlets curling over her
shoulders and down to her waist! if she is as charming
a woman as she was a child, I have not the
shadow of an objection. I used to call her my little
wife then, and the first poetry I ever perpetrated,
was some stanzas addressed to her on her birthday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she has shown them to me more than once;
she remembers you as well as you do her, and often
inquires of me about her cousin and old play-fellow,
Julius Rockwell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you think she would have me, uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t she?—you are plaguy good-looking,—you
know that well enough,—very much like
what I was at your age; you have sense plenty,—that
is, if you are not a degenerate shoot of your
family; if you have not, you must acquire it; you
have formed no bad habits, I hope;—if you have, I
must cane them out of you. And Etty will do whatever
I bid her,—I know she will. She is aware that
I was looking for you, and will expect you to call to
see her immediately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be delighted to do so; can you take me
this evening, uncle? But how does it happen that
she is in the city? Her parents, I believe, reside in
the country still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is with her aunt, Mrs. Attwood, a rich
widow, who having married off all her own daughters,
has begged a share of her time for the sake of her
company. She is very much of a belle, but if you
manage properly, you and she will make a match of
it in less than six months, or my name is not Herman
Holcroft. You must then live with me. I begin to
feel lonesome as I grow old, and, you perceive, I
have house-room for twenty more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear uncle, you are too kind!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop a moment! remember it is only on condition
you bring Etty with you; I don’t know that I would
like any one else. So I will go with you, and introduce
you to-night. I was afraid you would have to
wait to be provided with a new suit, but am agreeably
disappointed. You look not only genteel but
fashionable. Your country tailors must be on the
march of improvement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! since steam-engines are so abundant, no one
need be behind the fashions, unless he chooses;—but,
uncle,—look here, quick!—Ah! she has gone around
that corner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?—what is it?” asked the old bachelor,
hastily rising from his superb, damask covered rocking chair,
to approach the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A young lady,—the loveliest, brightest⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pho!” returned Mr. Holcroft, sinking again into
his cushions with a look of disappointment; “why I
see thousands of lovely, bright-looking girls passing
here every day, and so it has been for the last twenty
years. That, I suppose, is one reason why I have
not married. I never could get one pretty face fixed
in my heart, before a hundred others presented themselves
to drive it away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The windows of the apartment, in which the gentlemen
sat, opened upon one of the most noted
thoroughfares on this side of the Atlantic, which at
that hour, was crowded by an unusually brilliant
throng of the fair and the gay, called out by the
bright sunshine of a clear December afternoon, to
exhibit, each, her new assortment of winter finery.
During the foregoing dialogue, young Rockwell had
not been so much occupied as to be unable to throw
an occasional glance into the street, and the one
which preceded his exclamation, had been met by a
pair of radiant eyes, with an expression so cordial
and familiar, that he was quite startled,—and the
more easily, that they belonged to one of the most
beautiful faces and one of the richest costumes that
he had noticed on the crowded pavé. “I could never
have seen her before,—no, I never did,”—said he to
himself, and the passage of Moore so generally
known to the sentimental and romantic youths, who
sigh in our language, came into his mind:⁠—</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“As if his soul that moment caught</p>
<p class='line0'>An image it through life had sought;</p>
<p class='line0'>As if the very lips and eyes,</p>
<p class='line0'>Predestined to have all his sighs,</p>
<p class='line0'>And never be forgot again,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sparkled and smiled before him then.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“That is a favorite excuse with you old bachelors,”
said he, at length, remembering that a reply
might be expected to his uncle’s last observation;
“but this young lady,—<span class='it'>such</span> a face could not be
easily driven away! I wonder who she can be?—perhaps
you know her,—she is evidently one of your
<span class='it'>élite</span>, but I can’t describe her; one thing I noticed,
however, she had on a blue velvet—, what is the
name of those new articles?—neither a cloak nor a
shawl;—you understand what I mean, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mantilla, you block-head!” replied the old
bachelor, consequentially, as if proud of being so far
read in women’s gear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a mantilla,—a blue velvet mantilla, worked
in yellow figures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Embroidered in gold color, or straw, or canary,
or lemon, the ladies say,” returned Mr. Holcroft, in
a tone of correction; “there are plenty of blue
velvet mantillas, and how am I to know which you
mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius admitted that it might be rather difficult, and
looked out of the window with renewed interest,
while his uncle kept up a rambling discourse which
required no reply. In a few moments the blue mantilla
again appeared, another witching glance was
thrown upon him, and snatching up his hat, without
a word of explanation or excuse, he darted from the
room. Immediately after, a fine looking young man
entered, and was saluted by the name of Elkinton,
by Mr. Holcroft, who sat wondering at his nephew’s
sudden disappearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Rockwell arrived, Mr. Holcroft?” asked the
visiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,—did you not meet him at the door?—he
reached this an hour or two ago, and has just bolted
out as if life and death depended on his speed. I
suppose he saw something wonderful in the street.
These rustics, when they come to town, are always
on the stare for novelties. A fire-bell startles them
as much as an earthquake would us. But won’t you
sit down?—he will be back again in a few minutes,
no doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I have not time to wait. I merely
called in to see if he had come. Perhaps I may find
him in the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Julius was eagerly tracing the fair unknown,
and unpractised as he was in threading the
mazes of a city crowd, he found little difficulty in
gaining upon the light, quick step he followed. But
at length, as he joyfully held, his good genius befriended
him. She was stopped by a distinguished
looking girl, whose tall figure, dark eyes, and black
hair, contrasted strongly with her own rather <span class='it'>petite</span>
proportions, hazel eyes and ringlets of light brown.
He came up in time to hear the lady of his pursuit
say to the other, “I half expect visiters this evening,
but should they not call, I shall go certainly. I believe
it is the Vandenhoffs’ benefit, and, no doubt, a treat
may be looked for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a carriage drew up to the curbstone, and
an elderly lady called from it, “I have half a notion
to make you both walk home;—I have been driving
up and down street for an hour, expecting to meet
you. Get in,—quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steps were let down, and the black-eyed damsel
was handed in. Her companion was about to
follow, when, glancing over her shoulder, she beheld
our hero. She paused, half-smiled, blushed, and
springing into the carriage, was driven off, and out
of sight in a moment, while Julius stood transfixed
where she left him. He was aroused by a hand laid
on his arm, and turning, he exclaimed, somewhat
abashed at being found in a position so equivocal,
“Is it possible, Elkinton!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Rockwell! I am rejoiced to see you! I
almost passed without recognising you; I could
scarcely have expected to meet you, fresh from the
country, standing in a brown study, in the most
crowded square of the city!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young men had been classmates at college,
and though a regular correspondence had not
been kept up between them, they were always the
warmest of friends whenever they chanced to meet.
They turned to walk together towards Mr. Holcroft’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, Elkinton, do you know any lady who
wears a blue velvet mantilla?” asked Julius as soon
as politeness allowed him to introduce an extrinsic
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very probably I may, but I never recollect ladies
by their dress, as I seldom pay the slightest attention
to it. What sort of a lady do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A young, very beautiful one, with bright complexion,
clear hazel eyes and sunny tresses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know several such,—you may see plenty of
them passing any hour; but what about her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing! only I saw her in the street and
was struck with her appearance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! you will be struck ten times a minute
if you are on the look-out for beauty. For my part, I
have given up looking at the ladies in general.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it must be because you are engrossed by one
in particular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, and I’ll introduce you to her for old acquaintance
sake. Don’t you remember our standing
argument, that neither of us would marry without a
communication to, and a consultation with, the
other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” replied Julius abstractedly; “I must
try to find out who she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall know all about her, my Julius, and become
acquainted with her; as soon as you are at
leisure, I should like to have your impression of my
choice,” returned Elkinton cordially; of course alluding
to his own lady love; “but I have not time
to talk longer, just now. I’ll call to see you in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay, at which house are the Vandenhoffs to perform
to-night?” asked Julius, detaining him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elkinton named the theatre and hurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On returning to his uncle, there being visiters present,
no questions were asked about his absence, and
when they were again alone, the old gentleman desired
him to have himself in readiness to call on his
cousin, Miss Attwood, after tea. With some hesitation,
he excused himself. “Perhaps you would like
to go to see the Vandenhoffs, as this is their last
night,” said Mr. Holcroft, presuming that to be his
objection; “if so, by going early to visit Etty, we
may have a chance to take her along, if she is not
engaged. You need not mind being out of etiquette,
as I shall propose it myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Julius demurred about the visit, and added,
“It was my intention to go to the theatre, but I should
prefer going alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going alone!” repeated the old gentleman, looking
at him scrutinizingly; “that is altogether wrong,
Julius. A young man should not, if possible, appear
at a place of amusement, which ladies are sanctioned
to attend, without having one along. They are a
protection from improper associations, and add greatly
to the respectability of one’s appearance. On the
present occasion, your attendance on Henrietta
Attwood will establish your standing in society at
once. She is certainly one of the most admired girls
in the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt of it, uncle; but for my part I never
admired dumpy girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dumpy girls?—what do you intimate by that, sir?
why Etty has one of the most perfect figures I ever
saw! she is a very sylph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! when she was a child, she was very
short and fat. At any rate, she must have white
hair,—she formerly had,—and I have no great partiality
for ‘lint white locks.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White hair! what the plague has got into the
fellow? she has no such thing. An hour or two ago
you were all anxiety that I should take you to see
her, and you seem ready to decline going altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, uncle, but really I don’t feel in the
humor for ladies’ society this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well, sir; consult your own pleasure,”
replied the old bachelor in a tone of pique, and took
his tea in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius noticed it, but though sorry to displease
him, was ashamed to confess his motive for wishing
to go alone, and, after a few minutes of constraint, in
the drawing-room, he set off for the theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He arrived early, and selecting a place which
commanded a view of the whole house, he kept his
eyes in constant motion from door to door, with the
purpose of scanning every group that entered, a feat
not easy to accomplish, as an unusual number were
thronging the house. At length, a round of applause,
on the rising of the curtain, distracted his attention,
for a moment, and on again turning round, he beheld
in a box near him, the identical blue velvet mantilla,
accompanied by an elderly gentleman, and the tall
brunette. The best acting of the season was all lost
upon him, the one object alone chaining his eyes and
his thoughts. She, too, evidently perceived him,
while surveying the audience. At the end of the first
act, and several times afterward, she met his gaze
with conscious blushes, and an apparent effort to repress
a smile. He also fancied that some communication
on the subject passed between her and her
companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The play at length was over, and the party rose to
go. Julius pushed through the crowd until he found
himself beside them. In the press, the mantilla became
unfastened, and, unperceived, by its owner, a
gentleman set his foot upon it. “The lady’s mantilla,
sir!” said our hero, eagerly catching it up.
She nodded her thanks with looks half downcast, and
confusedly taking it from his hand, wrapped it around
her and, in a few minutes, they had reached the
door. The old gentleman handed his fair charges
into a carriage in waiting, and, saying that he would
walk, ordered the servant to drive on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a hack, sir?” asked a coachman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,—follow that carriage,” replied Julius, and
springing in, was driven into one of the most fashionable
streets of the city. The carriage stopped before
one of the handsomest houses in it, and he saw
the ladies alight and enter the door. Then discharging
his coach, he reconnoitered the house and square,
to know them again, and congratulating himself on
his discovery, he returned to his uncle’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Holcroft had recovered, in some degree,
from his displeasure against the morning, and with
a return of his usual manner, he questioned his
nephew upon the quality of the past night’s entertainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can hardly tell, sir; that is,—I believe it was
good, sir;” answered he with some incoherence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my good fellow, I hope you are not so
green as not to know whether a theatrical performance
was good or the contrary!” said the old bachelor,
staring at him, whereupon the young gentleman
felt himself necessitated to be somewhat less
abstracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast he took up his hat with unexpressed
intention to visit the scene of his discovery, and
half formed hopes, and his uncle, having observed
that in a stroll through the city he might see some
books, or other such matters, which he would like to
possess, kindly proffered him funds to purchase them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius thanked him, and answered that he was
provided with a sum, naming it, amply sufficient for
the expenses of the three or four weeks he had proposed
for the length of his visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t forget to be back again at twelve,” said
Mr. Holcroft; “against that time I shall want you
to go with me to see your cousin Etty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang my cousin Etty!” thought Julius, but he
said nothing, and, with a bow, he departed. On
reaching the place where his thoughts had been all
the morning, he examined the door, but could find no
name, nor could he see a child or a servant within
half a square, of whom he might have obtained information.
But, crossing the street in his disappointment,
he noticed on the first house before him, a
large brass door-plate, inscribed “<span class='sc'>Boarding</span>,” and
actuated by the first suggestion of his fancy, he rang
the bell, and inquired if he could obtain lodgings for a
short time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My rooms are all taken, sir,—that is, all the best
apartments,” replied the mistress of the mansion,
presuming, from his appearance, that none but good
accommodations would answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius paused a moment, but having gone so far,
he concluded not to draw back. “I would be willing
to put up with an inferior one, provided it is in the
front of the house,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The small room, in the third story, over the
entrance, is vacant,” said the lady, hesitating to
offer it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take it, madam,” he returned, and without
further question or examination, he hastened to have
his baggage brought. This he executed without the
knowledge of his uncle, the old gentleman having
rode out after breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt half ashamed of his precipitancy, when he
saw his trunks deposited in a chamber, so filled up
by a narrow bed, a washstand and a single chair, that
there was hardly space enough for them, but on approaching
the window, he beheld the blue mantilla
descending from the steps of the house opposite,
and he regarded himself as fully compensated for the
sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who lives in the house immediately across the
way?” asked he of the servant who was arranging
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Lawrenson, sir,—that gentleman coming
out.” It was the old gentleman of the theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are a couple of young ladies in the house,
are there not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only one, sir, that I know of,—a great belle
among the quality. The gentlemen call her the <span class='it'>beautiful</span>
Miss Lawrenson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius was satisfied. He knew the family by reputation,
and to have attracted the attention, and commenced
a flirtation of the eyes with a beauty so distinguished,
he felt was an adventure to be pursued
without respect to little inconveniences. He was
strengthened in this sentiment by some of the gentlemen
at the dinner-table stating, that one of the most
prominent ornaments of the dress circle, at the
theatre, the night before, was the beautiful Charlotte
Lawrenson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner he watched long for the return of
his fair neighbor, an occupation not the most comfortable,
as there was no chimney in the room, and
therefore no possibility of his having a fire; but she
did not again appear, and recollecting that his uncle
ought to be informed of his change of quarters, he
proceeded to fulfil that duty. On his way he had
some misgiving that the old gentleman would not
receive his apprisal on the best of terms, and he was
projecting some plausible excuse to satisfy him, when
the result of his ingenuity was annihilated by his encountering,
face to face, the lady of his thoughts,—his
heart, as he believed. The same half-smile met
him,—there might have been observed an additional
expression of familiarity;—the same blush, and he
would have turned to follow her again, but his sense
of propriety had not so far left him, as to admit of the
repetition,—particularly as there was no object to be
gained by it. So, satisfied that from his close vicinity,
he could have an opportunity of seeing her daily,
and of taking advantage of any favorable accident
for a better acquaintance, he entered the drawing-room
of the old bachelor, who received him with an
exclamation of “Where upon earth have you been
all this day, Julius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At my lodgings, sir,” replied the youth, having
come to the conclusion that it would be best to
treat his desertion in the most matter of course way
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your lodgings!” repeated Mr. Holcroft, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, uncle; as I don’t like to trouble my friends
more than I can help, I decided upon taking boarding,
and your absence, when I came to remove my baggage,
prevented my informing you of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, after I had proposed your taking up your
residence in my house, not only during your visit,
but during my life time! I need a better excuse than
that. Where have you gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius named the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the most expensive establishments in the
city, and one frequented by dandies, <span class='it'>roués</span>, and <span class='it'>bon
vivants</span>,—the very worst sort of society for a young
man, who aspires to attaining eminence in one of the
learned professions. You might, at least, have consulted
me about a place proper for you, even though
you had decided upon mortifying me by leaving my
house. How long have you engaged to stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a week or two, uncle,” replied Julius, devoutly
hoping that no questions would be asked,
which would compel him to confess that he had
ensconsed himself in the worst apartment in the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I waited dinner for you an hour, after having expected
you for two or three to go with me to visit
your cousin Etty. However, you can stay to tea, and
go with me in the evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, dear sir,—I have a particular reason
for declining.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! again?—how do you intend to dispose of
yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I shall stay in my own room, I believe, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You vex and surprise me more and more, Julius.
Independent of my earnest desire that you should
see your cousin, your duty as a gentleman and as a
relative requires that you should make her a visit,
and the sooner it is done, the more it will be to your
credit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young lady in question being only my
second-cousin, I cannot perceive that there is any
duty connected with the matter. Second-cousins,
except in cases of convenience, are seldom regarded
as relatives at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew! I presume that, after all that, I need
not be surprised if you should propose to dissolve the
connection between me and yourself! I, a queer,
plain, old fellow, will hardly be likely to remain an
<span class='it'>acknowledged</span> kinsman of one who declines the relationship
of one of the loveliest girls that ever the
sun shone upon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear uncle, I meant no disrespect towards
Miss Attwood, much less to you, but really, I have
something to attend to, that will debar me from the
pleasure of fulfilling your wishes, to-night. I will
see you again in the morning. Good evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must keep a sharp watch on that youngster,”
said the old bachelor to himself; “he can’t have
formed an attachment at home, for he appeared delighted,
at first, with my proposition for his settlement.
As to his leaving my house, it strikes me that
it was done for the purpose of escaping my <span class='it'>surveillance</span>.
I must be careful as to what sort of habits he
has formed, before I decide on carrying out my plans.
I must go to see Etty this evening myself, and as she
will expect some excuse for his not calling, I can
tell her that he is diffident,—not used to ladies’ society,
or something that way. She has not been
here for several days, I presume on his account; so
I’ll tell her that he has taken boarding at Mrs.
W⁠——’s. I have no notion of being cheated out of
my only lady visiter by the ungrateful scamp.” And
the old gentleman carried his resolve into execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius had really told the truth in saying that he
intended to remain at home that evening, but he
would not for any thing in the world,—except, indeed,
the heart under the blue velvet mantilla,—have
acknowledged his reason for so doing. The fact
was, he had concluded that no time was to be lost in
pursuing his advantage, and that, as he had been the
poet of his class at college, he might be inspired, if in
solitude, to produce a metrical accompaniment for
some pretty <span class='it'>gage d’amour</span>, to be sent the next morning.
His muse not unpropitious, but cabin’d, confined,
in his fireless dormitory, his ardour would, no
doubt, have abated, had he not, by an occasional
glance out of the window, been reminded, by the
blue sky and its golden embroidery of stars, of the
azure mantilla. Thus refreshed, whenever he found
himself flagging, he completed his performance to his
full satisfaction, and after copying it on paper perfumed
and gilt,—with his washstand for a writing
table,—he retired to dream the night into day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning, as soon as breakfast was over, he
set off in quest of his intended gift, and seeing the
gorgeous display of exotics, in the window of a celebrated
florist, he stopped and selected flowers for a
bouquet, the richest and rarest, without regard to
cost, and ordering them to be sent immediately to
his lodgings, he hastened to meet them there. He
was stopped, however, in his course by his friend
Elkinton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad at the accident of meeting you,” said
the latter; “I called last evening and this morning
at Mr. Holcroft’s in expectation of your coming in,—the
servants having told me yesterday that you had
changed your residence. Where do you lodge?—your
uncle was not at home, and, consequently, I did
not ascertain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius evaded an answer, afraid of exposing to any
acquaintance how comfortless a place he had deposited
himself in, and though they had now nearly
reached it, he walked off in a contrary direction to
avoid suspicion, talking all the while with much
more animation than he would have been likely to do
in his present state of feeling, if there had not been a
strong motive to prompt him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any engagement for this evening?”
asked Elkinton; “if not, I will take you to see my
<span class='it'>fiancée</span>, as I promised you the other day. I really
wish to have your congratulations on my selection.
All the fellows of my acquaintance regard me with
envy;—you need not smile,—I say it without vanity
or boasting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius declined without offering an excuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will you go then?” persisted the intruder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,—in truth I go very little into ladies’
society at present,” replied Rockwell, with an air of
<span class='it'>nonchalance</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That his friend should be totally indifferent towards
his mistress, is little less unpardonable to a lover,
than that he should attempt to rival him in her affections;
accordingly Elkinton, after replying coolly,
“very well, I hold you to no appointment,” bowed
stiffly, and walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not giving his friend’s change of deportment a
thought, Julius hastened to his room, where the
flowers had arrived before him, and folded his poetical
billet-doux to send with them. How to direct it
was the next question, and determining that it would
be disrespectful, without his having an introduction,
to address it to “Miss Lawrenson,” he substituted,
in place of her name, to “The Blue Velvet Mantilla.”
He then rang the bell, and giving the waiter who appeared,
a liberal douceur to carry it across the street,
and leave it for Miss Lawrenson, with the bouquet,
he watched at the window until he saw it delivered
to a servant at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other boarders having left the parlors, he
took possession of one of the front windows with a
newspaper in his hand, and watched every movement
across the way. In a short time the tall brunette
emerged from the doorway, but her companion
of the sunny ringlets did not appear. After dinner
she really did present herself,—he was on the watch
again;—and he noticed that, before she reached the
steps, she glanced across with apparent curiosity,
from which he conjectured that she had discovered,
by means of the servant, whence the offering had
come. And then, when she turned to look again,
after she had pulled the bell, he was confident that
she recognised his figure at the window. Towards
evening he tore himself from his loadstone long
enough to saunter out with the object of paying his
respects to his uncle, but the old gentleman not being
in the house, he did not enter, and returning to his
room, he busied himself, as the evening before, in
writing verses for a future occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ended one day of folly, and the next was
spent in a similar manner, except that he sent a
costly English annual, as his second tribute, and, to
his surprise and ecstasy, received, in return, by his
messenger, a geranium leaf, enclosed in a sheet of
rose-colored note-paper, in which was inscribed, in
a dainty female hand, the single line,—“From the
Blue Velvet Mantilla.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third day, he sent a present equally elegant,
and employed some of the most skilful members of a
famous band to discourse their most elegant music
under her window in the night, and he felt not a little
flattered, secretly, to hear some of the boarders pronounce
it the most delightful serenade ever heard,
even in the neighborhood of Miss Lawrenson. But
it would be tedious to follow him in his extravagances.
He dispensed his flowers, and books, and
music, and tasteful <span class='it'>bijoux</span> as prodigally as if he had
possessed the purse of a Fortunio, until better than a
week had passed. During this time he forced himself
to call daily on his uncle, and daily declined a
visit to his cousin, until the old gentleman, deeply offended,
ceased to invite him to his house, and he for
the same reason, ceased to go. Elkinton, too, met
him once or twice, and, in remembrance of his want
of courtesy, passed him with merely a nod, but what
was all that, in comparison with the compensation
he received from the lady of the mantilla?—sundry
glances and blushes, when he chanced to meet her
on the street; a wave of her scarf across the window,
which could not have been accidental; and above
all, two several notes, containing, each, familiar
quotations, in her own delicate hand, as answers to
some of his impassioned rhapsodies. A new incident,
however, brought him somewhat to his senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning his messenger, on returning, presented
him with a note, markedly different, from its bold
penmanship, to the others, and on opening it, he read
to the following effect.⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The person, who, for a week past, has been so
liberal of his favors to Miss C⁠—— L⁠——, is requested
to call this afternoon, three o’clock, at No. 26, —— Hotel,
and explain his conduct to one possessed of a
right to demand it. Should he not comply, it will be
presumed that he is unworthy of being treated as a
gentleman, and he shall be dealt with accordingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From whom did you receive this?” asked he of
the servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Mr. Lawrenson’s footman, sir, who always
receives my messages; he said it was given to
him by a gentleman who ordered him not to tell his
name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well; that is sufficient,” said Julius, with
considerably more self-possession than if it had contained
another quotation or geranium leaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What explanation should he make?—was he to
meet a father, or a brother? whom? or, what? was
he to be called upon to apologize, or to fight? or what
was to be done? He could settle none of these questions
to his satisfaction, and so he concluded to remain
as unconcerned as possible, and be guided by
the relative position and deportment of his challenger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The appointed hour came, and found our hero at
the house designated. He asked to be shown to No.
26, and, on rapping at the door, to his surprise, it
was opened by Elkinton. The latter, also, looked
surprised, but presuming that he had called to atone
for his former unfriendliness, he invited him in, and
seated him, with much cordiality. Julius looked
around, and perceiving no other person in the room,
took the letter from his pocket, and remarked—“There
must be some mistake here. To confess
the truth, Elkinton, I did not expect to find myself in
your apartment. This note directed me to number
26, but it must be a mistake of the pew. However,
as I am here, I would be very glad of your advice as
a friend. Read this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elkinton glanced at the note, and, with a heightened
color, returned, “There must, indeed, be some
mistake. I am the writer of this, but you, certainly,
cannot be the person for whom it was intended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius started, but commanded himself to reply
coolly,—“Judging from its import, it undoubtedly
was destined for my hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elkinton paced the room once or twice, and then,
seating himself beside his visiter, remarked, “This
is a delicate affair, Julius, but, as old friends, let us
talk it over quietly. That there may be no misunderstanding,
let us be certain that we both interpret
these initials alike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I presumed them to be those of Miss Lawrenson,—Charlotte
Lawrenson,” answered Julius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She, indeed, is the person meant, and to prove
to you my right to interfere in this matter, she is the
lady to whom I am engaged, of which I informed
you,—who is affianced to be my wife in a few
months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius sprang to his feet, and turned pale as marble.
To be thus flirted and betrayed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” pursued Elkinton, earnestly, “you will
understand why I should have felt indignant at any
one presuming to make such advances, as you have
done, towards the lady in question, and you will not
be surprised if I ask by what you were encouraged to
persist in them, so assiduously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the lady’s own conduct,” said Julius, with
his usual impetuosity; “by her accepting my presents,
which were invariably accompanied by expressions
of admiration,—nay, of passion; by her
noticing those expressions with answers, which, if
not explicitly favorable, could not have been construed
otherwise, as they were not reprobatory; by
tokens of personal recognition from her house, and
by conscious, and not discouraging looks, whenever
we met in the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay, Julius! these are serious charges, and such
as no man could patiently listen to of his affianced
wife. Your presents I know she received, for from
her jestingly showing them to me, and pointing out
the house from which they came, I was led to write
the note in your hand, of which she is aware; but
that a girl of Charlotte Lawrenson’s dignity of character
would answer love-letters from an entire stranger,
and exchange coquettish glances with him in
the streets, is more than I can credit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is language, Elkinton, that I cannot and will
not submit to,” retorted Julius angrily; “if you
must have proofs farther than the word of a man of
honor, take these!” and he drew the notes from his
bosom, where, in the most approved fashion of lovers,
he had kept them secured day and night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elkinton snatched them, and after a scrutinizing
examination replied, “I can say, almost positively,
that not a word here is in her handwriting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt, you find it very satisfactory to feel
thus assured,” said Julius, with a sarcastic smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To save further dispute, by which neither of us
can be convinced,” returned Elkinton, endeavoring
to be more composed, “I will go directly to Miss
Lawrenson, and ask an explanation from her, without
which, I at least, cannot feel satisfied. If you shall
be at leisure, I will call on you, or, if you prefer it,
shall expect you here at eight this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For particular reasons, unnecessary to specify,
Julius chose the latter, and Elkinton, escorting him
out with cold politeness, proceeded, in much perturbation,
to the mansion of Mr. Lawrenson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero was punctual to his appointment in the
evening, and found Elkinton impatiently awaiting
him. “I have laid your representations before Miss
Lawrenson, and, for your sake, am sorry that she
disclaims their veracity. Though she again acknowledges
having your presents in her possession, she
denies having answered your notes, or even having
opened them; denies ever having given you a mark
of recognition, and denies that, to her knowledge,
she ever saw you in the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius stood aghast. To have the truth so pointedly
disowned, to have his word so plainly doubted,
it was not to be borne. “Her retaining my love-tokens,
I think, might be sufficient evidence to you
that all is not exactly as you would desire,” he replied
indignantly, “a woman who encourages the advances
of a total stranger, in everything but words, while
betrothed to another, and then, to preserve his favor,
denies the whole course of her conduct, is unworthy
the notice of any man who calls himself a
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing can yet be done,” said Elkinton, repressing
a furious answer; “let me have those notes,
and, through them, Miss Lawrenson may probably
be enabled to discover by whom they were produced.
If that cannot be done, I shall hold you responsible
for gross misrepresentations of her character;” and
he strode out, leaving his rival in possession of his
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matters now wore a serious aspect. Should the
lady make no confession, a challenge would be the
consequence, and even should she vouchsafe to explain,
it would be to make him a laughing stock by
proving him quizzed, coquetted and jilted. If the
first were to occur, it behoved him to prepare to leave
the world; if the latter, at least to leave the city.
And on his way homeward, he decided to put his affairs
in order. He remembered that his landlady
had sent in her bill that morning, requiring money
for a pressing engagement, and that, having pretty
well exhausted his funds in his expensive outlays for
his fair enchantress, he had concluded to apply to his
uncle for means to discharge it. Accordingly he
stopped to inquire for him, but not finding him at
home, he left on his secretaire a note, requesting the
loan of the sum he required, and saying he would
call for it in the morning. He then retired to his
lodgings in such a state of excitement as it had not
been his lot before to experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning, when completing his toilet, for
breakfast, he heard the sound of a stick and an unusually
heavy step on the stairs, and after a loud rap
on the door, Mr. Holcroft, to his great surprise, presented
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” said the old bachelor, seating himself on the
side of the bed, the only chair being occupied by
Julius’ collar and cravat, and looking around in
astonishment, “a pretty exchange you have made,
young gentleman, for the pleasant apartments to
which I welcomed you on your arrival!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius saw that his ire was aroused, but unable to
conjecture why, and somewhat abashed at the shabbiness
of his surroundings, he could only stammer
something about having found it impossible to obtain
the accommodation of a better room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what are your reasons, young man, for submitting
to such discomforts and inconveniences?—You
need not take the trouble to fabricate an answer.
Your last night’s demand for money has given me a
full insight into your character and pursuits, and I
have come to assert my tacit right as your mother’s
brother, and your nearest living relation, to use the
power of a guardian, and remove you from scenes
in which you are in a fair way to prove a disgrace to
me and to the memory of your parents. On your
arrival in the city, I laid before you my plans for
your future benefit,—that you should make your
home with me as my son, and my prospective heir,
an offer which almost any young man would have
considered extraordinary good fortune,—and suggested
to you an alliance which, I felt confident, would
secure your happiness. I was not such an old block-head
to expect you to marry your cousin without
your own conviction that she would suit you, but
merely named her to you as a woman who, to any
reasonable man, would be a treasure, such as, I fear,
you will never deserve to possess. Then, instead of
calling on your cousin, as I requested, if only through
civility to me,—you displayed a churlish indifference
to female society, which young men of good principles
and education seldom feel, and to escape from
the watch and control which you supposed I would
keep on your movements,—you clandestinely left my
house. To be sure, you did make a show of respect,
by coming occasionally to see me, but your abstracted
manner, and entire silence as to your engagements
and mode of spending the time, confirmed my suspicions
that your amusements were such as you
were ashamed to confess them to be. On one occasion,
however, you committed yourself,—in naming
the amount of funds you had brought with you,—quite
sufficient for any young man of good habits for
a month, situated as you are; and now, though I am
perfectly willing to give you the sum you require,
and as much in addition, as will take you away from
temptation as far as you may choose to go, I demand
in return, to know how your own has been spent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hurt, mortified and vexed at suspicions so unjust
and injurious, Julius did not attempt to interrupt him,
and against he concluded, had made up his mind to
confess the whole truth, which he did, circumstantially
and minutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it be possible that my sister’s son should
have made such a fool of himself?” exclaimed the
old gentleman, raising his hands in amazement, “that
you should have given up the comforts of my house,
and the pleasures of the agreeable society you would
have met there, for this inconvenient dungeon in a
boarding-house; squandered your money like a tragedy
hero, and put yourself into a situation to shoot,
or to be shot by, one of your best friends, all for the
sake of a girl who was silly and impudent enough to
cast a few coquettish glances at you in the street!
truly! truly!—however, it is not quite so bad as I
apprehended, certainly less unpardonable that you
should play the idiot than to have turned out a gambler
or <span class='it'>roué</span>, as I suspected. But just see how easily
all this might have been avoided!—merely by your
going with me to see your cousin, and falling in love
with her, and thus putting yourself out of danger of
becoming entangled in the snares of another. It is a
lucky thing for you, my gentle Romeo, that we came
to an understanding so soon, for I had made up my
mind, partly, to marry Mrs. Attwood, the widow,
right off, and as Etty would have been a sort of niece,
to make her my heiress. What d’ye think of that?
But there’s your breakfast bell, and my carriage is
waiting for me. Go down, and in half an hour I
will call and take you home with me. In the meantime
I will see Elkinton, and try if the matter can’t
be settled without pistols.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the half-hour Mr. Holcroft returned,
and apprising Julius that he had made an appointment
with Elkinton to meet him at eleven, he took
him away, talking all the time with much spirit, evidently
to engage and amuse the thoughts of the
chagrined and disappointed lover. This seemed to
have little effect, when, thinking of another expedient,
he ordered his coachman to stop at the rooms
of an eminent painter, where, he stated to Julius,
he was getting some pictures executed, which he
would like him to examine. He would take no
refusal, and the young gentleman was obliged to
alight and accompany him into the gallery. When
they had reached it, he found no difficulty in recognizing
the first piece pointed out to him as the
portrait of his uncle himself, and after giving it
the appropriate measure of approbation, he strolled
away, on seeing the artist approach. With occasionally
a cursory glance at them, he walked in
front of a row of ladies and gentlemen, who smiled
upon him from the canvass in a manner that, to his
moodiness, appeared quite tantalizing, and, at length,
an exclamation from him drew Mr. Holcroft to his
side, who found him gazing pale and breathless upon
a picture, the very counterpart, even to the blue velvet
mantilla, of the one in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what’s the matter?—whom do you recognize
there?” asked the old bachelor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She,—herself,—the fair cause of my late—insanity;”
answered he, with an unsuccessful effort to
return the smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?—that?—the original of that! Whew! ha!
ha!” exclaimed the old gentleman with a stare and
then a boisterous laugh; “and is it she, that you
have allowed to put you on the road to Bedlam!—a
dumpy little thing like that! ha! ha! But I see that
I have frustrated my own intention, in bringing you
here to compose you. Don’t stand there in such an
attitude, and looking so wo-begone, or Mr. —— will
make a caricature of you; he has his keen eye fixed
on you now, come along!” and Julius followed unwillingly
down stairs, his uncle laughing all the way
in a manner that was excessively provoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes they had reached home. “I’ll
not get out,” said the old bachelor, “just go in and
amuse yourself, until I return, which will be shortly.
Be sure that you wait for me, as I wish to be present
at your interview with Elkinton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius did as he was requested, and in due time his
uncle returned. “Come now,” said he, “I have
no doubt that the young lady will make a confession,
and that you will escape with your character untarnished
except by folly. Then after we have got over
our business with Elkinton, if it should be settled
amicably, we will go to see your cousin Henrietta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear uncle! I beseech you do not propose my
going to visit a lady, in my present frame of mind!
I really should disgrace both myself and you. Make
my excuses to Etty, and when I have returned to the
city, after I shall have banished the remembrance
of my disappointment by a few months in the country,
I will endeavour to do everything that is proper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forgot to tell you,” said Mr. Holcroft, “that we
are not to meet Elkinton at his lodgings, but in a
private house; an arrangement made, I suspect, that
Miss Lawrenson might be present, to make an explanation
of her conduct. Here is the place, now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julius started, but the carriage stopped, and he
followed his uncle in silence. They were ushered
into an elegant drawing-room, and on an ottoman, in
full view of the door, sat the blue velvet mantilla.—She
bowed to Mr. Holcroft, and looked at Julius, as
if quite prepared to confront him. The sight of her
convinced him that he was not yet cured of his passion,
but before he had had any time to betray it, his
uncle took him by the arm, and said as he drew him
forward, “Allow me, Julius, to present you to your
cousin Henrietta Attwood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most unnecessary thing in the world, Mr. Holcroft,”
returned the lady rising, “as I would have
known my cousin Julius anywhere. He, however, I
presume, would not have found it so easy to recognize
me!” and looking into his face with a merry, ringing
laugh, she approached him, and held out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Confounded by the many emotions that crowded
upon him, Julius stood speechless, and almost afraid
to touch it, when her laugh was echoed from the adjoining
room and Elkinton appeared, accompanied by
the dark-eyed damsel, whom our hero had seen as the
companion of his cousin, and introduced her as Miss
Lawrenson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Rockwell,” said he, heartily grasping
Julius’ hand, “I am delighted to meet you again as
one of the most valued of my friends. We have good
reason to congratulate each other that we did not fall
victims to a stratagem, planned by these cruel nymphs,
as cunning as ever was devised by Circe of old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, stop, Elkinton!” interrupted the old bachelor,
“as the merit of the <span class='it'>dénouement</span> is mine, I think
I am entitled to make a speech to Julius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now, not here, before us! dear Mr. Holcroft!”
exclaimed both the girls laughing and blushing,
but as he showed signs of proceeding, they ran
away, and left the gentlemen by themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to Mr. Holcroft’s explanation, Henrietta
had recognized her cousin on the day of his arrival,
which fully accounted for her pleasant glances; and
from his following her in the street, approaching her
at the theatre, and tracing her to Mr. Lawrenson’s,
which that gentleman had observed, she presumed
that she was equally known to him, and, of course,
wondered that he did not avail himself of the easier
method of renewing their acquaintance by means of
his uncle. But on discovering, from Mr. Holcroft’s
representations, that she was mistaken, learning his
change of residence, and receiving through Miss
Lawrenson, his verses, in which she recognized his
hand, she was struck with a clearer perception of the
case, and she determined to engage in the flirtation,
and pursue it until he should make her a visit, as a
relation, and then have a laugh at his expense. Miss
Lawrenson, in return for assisting her, by receiving
his communications, claimed the privilege of having
some amusement of her own out of the adventure,
and to effect this, she made use of his beautiful gifts
to excite the jealousy of Elkinton; they both, however,
discovered that they had carried the game too far,
and alarmed at the turn it had taken, had sent for Elkinton,
an hour or two before, from Mrs. Attwood’s,
and made a full confession. There Mr. Holcroft had
found him, when he called to inform Etty of his discovery
in the picture-room, and of his nephew’s difficulties,
and there the grand finale was projected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must have been my indistinct and unconscious
recollection of my old play-fellow, after all,” said
Julius, “which so attracted me, and it was her
getting out of the carriage at Mr. Lawrenson’s and
being there so often, which brought you into the
drama, Elkinton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she is to be our bridesmaid, and, no doubt,
she and Charlotte have a good many little matters to
talk over;—that accounts for their being so much
together. She stayed over night the time in question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, it is a mercy that in their confabulations
they did not set you two blowing each other’s
brains out; and it would have been no wonder,
Julius, if such a catastrophe had happened, to punish
you for your disobedience,” said the old bachelor,
“now, if you had obliged me, like a dutiful nephew,
by calling on your cousin, and acted a friend’s part
towards Elkinton, by going to see his sweetheart,
everything would have ended properly without any
of this trouble. But it is too often the case that people
run after all sorts of shadows, and get themselves
into all sorts of scrapes, in their search after happiness,
when they could find it at once by quietly attending
to their duties at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young ladies returned, and, through delicacy
towards them, no allusion was made to the subject
just canvassed, but Julius, on returning with his
uncle to dinner, declared his intention of offering
himself to Etty that very evening, if he should find
an opportunity. This the old gentleman expressly
forbade, giving him a fortnight as a term of probation;
but whether he was obeyed more closely in this than in
his former requisitions, was, from certain indications,
a matter of doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the two weeks, there was a friendly
contest between Rockwell and Elkinton, as to which
must wait to be the groomsman of the other. It was
left to the decision of Mr. Holcroft, who declared in
favor of the latter, he having determined to serve in
that capacity, towards his nephew himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did so, in the course of a few months, and
though Julius has not had time to rise, as his substitute,
to the height of the profession, he has carried
out the original plan so far as to have furnished the
Holcroft mansion with a boy, athletic enough already
to ride on his grand uncle’s cane, and a girl, so ingenious
as to have, occasionally, made a doll’s cradle
of his rocking chair.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He dropt upon a rock, and by him placed,</p>
<p class='line0'>Over a bed of sea-pinks growing waste,</p>
<p class='line0'>The silent ladye, and he mutter’d wild,</p>
<p class='line0'>Strange words, about a mother, and no child.</p>
<p class='line0'>“And I shall wed thee, Agathè! although</p>
<p class='line0'>Ours be no God—blest bride—even so!”</p>
<p class='line0'>And from the sand he took a silver shell,</p>
<p class='line0'>That had been wasted by the fall and swell</p>
<p class='line0'>Of many a moon-borne tide into a ring⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A rude, rude ring; it was a snow-white thing,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where a lone hermit limpet slept and died,</p>
<p class='line0'>In ages far away.—“Thou art a bride,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sweet Agathè! wake up; we must not linger.”</p>
<p class='line0'>He press’d the ring upon her chilly finger,</p>
<p class='line0'>And to the sea-bird, on its sunny stone,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shouted,—“Pale priest! that liest all alone</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon thy ocean-altar, rise away</p>
<p class='line0'>To our glad bridal!” and its wings of gray</p>
<p class='line0'>All lazily it spread, and hover’d by</p>

<p class='line0'>Of the blue ocean, vanish’d in the west.</p>
<p class='line0'>And Julio is chanting to his bride,</p>
<p class='line0'>A merry song of his wild heart, that died</p>
<p class='line0'>On the soft breeze through pinks beside the sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>All rustling in their beauty gladsomely.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The fiery moon, that in her blazonry</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Shone eastward, like a shield. The throbbing sea</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Felt fever on his azure arteries,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Where slept a seraph host maritimal,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Was gorgeous, with wings of diamond</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fann’d over it, and millions beyond</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of tiny waves were playing to and fro,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;All musical, with an incessant flow</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of cadences, innumerably heard</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Between the shrill notes of a hermit bird,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That held a solemn pæan to the moon.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A few devotional fair clouds were soon</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Breath’d o’er the living countenance of Heaven,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of stars that group’d together, and they went</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like voyagers along the firmament,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And grew to silver in the blessed light</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of the moon alchymist. It was not night,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Not the dark deathly shadow, that falls o’er</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The eye-lid like a curse, but far before</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In splendor, struggling through a fall of gloom,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In many a myriad gushes, that do come</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Direct from the eternal stars beyond,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like holy fountains pouring diamond!</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A sail! awake thee, Julio! a sail!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And be not bending to thy trances pale.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But he is gazing on the moonlit brow</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of his dead Agathè, and fondly now,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The light is silvering her bloodless face</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the cold grave-clothes. There is loveliness</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As in a marble image, very bright!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But stricken with a phantasy of light</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That is not given to the mortal hue,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To life and breathing beauty: and she too</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Is more of the expressless lineament,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Than of the golden thoughts that came and went</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Over her features, like a living tide</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;No while before.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And moving waters, and it draweth nigh</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like a sea-cloud. The elfin billows fly</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Before it, in their armories enthrall’d</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of radiant and moon-breasted emerald:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And many is the mariner that sees</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That lone boat in the melancholy breeze,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Waving her snowy canvass, and anon</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Their stately vessel with a gallant run</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Crowds by in all her glory; but the cheer</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of men is pass’d into a sudden fear,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And whisperings, and shaking of the head.⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The moon was streaming on a virgin dead,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And Julio sat over her insane,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like a sea demon! o’er and o’er again,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Each cross’d him, as the stately vessel stood</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Far out into the murmuring solitude!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A rushing, like the passing of a bird,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And felt him heaving on the foam, that flew</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Along the startled billows: and he knew</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of a strange sail, by broken oaths that fell</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Beside him, on the coming of the swell.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They saw thee, Agathè! and go to bring</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fair worshippers, and many a poet-king,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To utter music at thy pearly feet.⁠—</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And on its dewy plume there is a light</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of palest splendor, o’er the blessed night.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thy spirit, Agathè!—and yet thou art</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Into my feverous and burning brain,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So wake not! and I’ll hush thee with a strain</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of my wild fancy, till thou dream of me,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;’Tis light to love thee living, girl, when hope is full and fair</p>
<p class='line0'>In the springtide of thy beauty, when there is no sorrow there⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>No sorrow on thy brow, and no shadow on thy heart!</p>
<p class='line0'>When, like a floating sea-bird, bright and beautiful thou art!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>’Tis light to love thee living, girl—to see thee ever so,</p>
<p class='line0'>With health, that, like a crimson flower, lies blushing in the snow;</p>
<p class='line0'>And thy tresses falling over, like the amber on the pearl⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! true, it is a <span class='it'>lightsome</span> thing, to love thee living, girl:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But when the brow is blighted, like a star at morning tide,</p>
<p class='line0'>And faded is the crimson blush upon the cheek beside:</p>
<p class='line0'>It is to love as seldom love, the brightest and the best,</p>
<p class='line0'>When our love lies like a dew upon the one that is at rest,</p>
<p class='line0'>Because of hopes that fallen are changing to despair,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the heart is always dreaming on the ruin that is there.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, true! ’tis weary, weary, to be gazing over thee,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the light of thy pure vision breaketh never upon me!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He lifts her in his arms, and o’er and o’er,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Upon the brow of chilliness and hoar,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Repeats a silent kiss:—along the side</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of the lone bark, he leans that pallid bride,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Until the waves do image her within</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Their bosom, like a spectre—’tis a sin</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Too deadly to be shadow’d or forgiven</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To do such mockery in the sight of Heaven!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And bid her gaze into the startled sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And say, “Thy image, from eternity,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hath come to meet thee, ladye!” and anon</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He bade the cold corse kiss the shadowy one,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That shook amid the waters, like the light</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of borealis in a winter night!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And after, he did strain her sea-wet hair</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Between his chilly fingers, with a stare</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of mystery, that marvell’d how that she</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Had drench’d it so amid the moonlit sea.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The morning rose, with breast of living gold,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like eastern phœnix, and his plumage roll’d</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In clouds of molted brilliance, very bright!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And on the waste of waters floated light.⁠—</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In truth, ’twas strange to see that merry bark</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Skimming the silver ocean, like a shark</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;At play amid the beautiful sea-green,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And all so sadly desolate within.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And hours flew after hours, a weary length,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Until the sunlight, in meridian strength,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Threw burning floods upon the wasted brow</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of that sea-hermit mariner; and now</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He felt the fire-light feed upon his brain,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And started with intensity of pain,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And washed him in the sea;—it only brought</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Wild reason, like a demon; and he thought</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Strange thoughts, like dreaming men,—he thought how those</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Were round him he had seen, and many rose</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;His heart had hated; every billow threw</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Features before him, and pale faces grew</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Out of the sea by myriads:—the self-same</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Was moulded from its image, and they came</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In groups together, and all said, like one,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Be cursed!” and vanish’d in the deep anon.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then thirst, intolerable as the breath</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of Upas, fanning the wild wings of death,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Crept up his very gorge,—like to a snake,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That stifled him, and bade the pulses ache</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Through all the boiling current of his blood.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It was a thirst, that let the fever flood</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fall over him, and gave a ghastly hue</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To his cramp’d lips, until their breathing grew</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;White as a mist and short, and like a sigh,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Heaved with a struggle, till it faltered by.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And ever he did look upon the corse</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With idiot visage, like the hag Remorse</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That gloateth over on a nameless deed</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of darkness and of dole unhistoried.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And were there that might hear him, they would hear</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The murmur of a prayer in deep fear</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Through unbarr’d lips, escaping by the half,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And all but smother’d by a maniac laugh,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That follow’d it, so sudden and so shrill,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That swarms of sea-birds, wandering at will</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Upon the wave, rose startled, and away</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Went flocking, like a silver shower of spray!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And aye he called for water, and the sea</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Mock’d him with his brine surges tauntingly,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And lash’d them over on his fev’rous brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Volleying roars of curses,—“Stay thee, now,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Avenger! lest I die; for I am worn</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fainter than star-light at the birth of morn;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Stay thee, great angel! for I am not shriven,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But frantic as thyself: Oh! Heaven! Heaven!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But thou hast made me brother of the sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That I may tremble at his tyranny:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Or am I slave? a very, very jest</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To the sarcastic waters? let me breast</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The base insulters, and defy them so,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In this lone little skiff.—I am your foe!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Ye raving, lion-like, and ramping seas,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That open up your nostrils to the breeze,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And fain would swallow me! Do ye not fly,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Pale, sick, and gurgling, as I pass you by?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Lift up! and let me see, that I may tell</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Ye can be mad, and strange, and terrible;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That ye have power, and passion, and a sound,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As of the flying of an angel round</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The mighty world: that ye are one with time,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And in the great primordium sublime</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Were cursed together, as an infant-twain,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A glory and a wonder! I would fain</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hold truce, thou elder brother! for we are,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In feature, as the sun is to a star.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So are we like, and we are touch’d in tune</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With lunacy as music; and the moon,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That setteth the tides sentinel before</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thy camp of waters, on the pebbled shore,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And measures their great footsteps to and fro,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hath lifted up into my brain the flow</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of this mad tide of blood—ay? we are like</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In foam and frenzy; the same winds do strike,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The same fierce sun-rays, from their battlement</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of fire! so, when I perish impotent</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Before the might of death, they’ll say of me,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He died as mad and frantic as the sea!”</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A cloud stood for the East, a cloud like night,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It seemed to mount up from the mighty sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Shaking the showers from its solemn wings,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And grew, and grew, and many a myriad springs</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Were on its bosom, teeming full of rain.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;There fell a terrible and wizard chain</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of lightning, from its black and heated forge,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the dark waters took it to their gorge,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And lifted up their shaggy flanks in wonder</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With rival chorus to the peal of thunder,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That wheel’d in many a squadron terrible</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;His wasted hands, in likeness of a cup,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And drank the blessed waters, and they roll’d</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Having</span> thus become acquainted with the two Miss
Byleses, and understanding that they were always
delighted when strangers were brought to see them
in a similar manner, I afterwards became the introducer
of several friends from other cities, who successively
visited Boston in the course of that summer,
and who expressed a desire to pay their compliments
to these singular old ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every instance, the same routine was pursued
upon these occasions by the two sisters, and the
practice of nearly half a century had, of course, made
them perfect in it. I was told by a lady who had
known the Miss Byleses long and intimately, and had
introduced to them, at their house, not less than fifty
persons, that she had never observed the slightest
variation in their usual series of sayings and doings.
And so I always found it, whenever I brought them a
new visitor. Miss Mary always came to receive us
at the front door,—and Miss Catharine always produced
her own effect by not making her appearance,
till we had sat sometime in the parlour. The attention
of the stranger was always, in the same words,
directed to the cornelian ring on their father’s picture,
and always the new guests were placed in the
great carved chair, and the same wonder was expressed
that “they should sit easy under the crown.”
Always did their visiter hear the history of “their
nephew, poor boy, whom they had not seen for forty
years.” Always did Miss Catharine with the same
diffidence exhibit the snake,—and always was the
snake unwilling to re-enter his box, till he had been
brought to obedience by a little wholesome chastisement.
The astounding trick of the alphabetical bits
of paper was unfailingly shown;—and, always when
the visiters gave symptoms of departure, did Miss
Mary slip out of the room, and lock the front door,
that she might have an opportunity of repeating her
excellent joke about the ladies’ night caps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very desirable that all ladies and gentlemen,
taken to see the Miss Byleses, should have sufficient
tact to be astonished up to the exact point at the exhibition
of their curiosities, that they should laugh,
just enough, at their witticisms; and that they
should humor, rather than controvert, their gratuitous
manifestations of loyalty to the person they called
their rightful king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend Mr. Sully, (who was glad to have an
opportunity of seeing Copley’s portrait of Dr. Byles,)
enacted his part <span class='it'>à mervëílle</span>;—or rather, it was no
acting at all; but the genuine impulse of his kind and
considerate feelings, and of his ever-indulgent toleration
for the peculiarities of such minds as are not so
fortunate as to resemble his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another gentleman who was desirous of an introduction
to the sisters, rather alarmed me by over-doing
his part,—and, as I thought, being rather <span class='it'>too</span> much
amazed at the curiosities; and rather too mirthful at
the jokes,—and rather too warm in praising kings and
deprecating presidents. But on this occasion, I threw
away a great deal of good uneasiness, for I afterwards
found that the Miss Byleses, spoke of this very gentleman
as one of the most sensible and agreeable men
they had ever seen,—and one who had exactly the
right way of talking and behaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lady who testified a wish to accompany me
on a visit to the Miss Byleses, found little either to
interest or amuse her,—the truth was, that being
unable to enter the least into their characters, she
looked very gravely all the time, and afterwards told
me she saw nothing in them but foolishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must do the Miss Byleses the justice to say, that
they appeared to much less advantage on these the
first visits of new people, than to those among the
initiated, who took sufficient interest in them to cultivate
an after-acquaintance. I went sometimes alone
to sit an hour with them towards the decline of a summer
afternoon,—and then I always found them infinitely
more rational than when “putting themselves
through their facings,” to show off to strangers. In
the course of these quiet visits, they told me many
little circumstances connected with the royalist side
of our revolutionary contest, that I could scarcely
have obtained from any other source,—the few persons
yet remaining among us that were tories during
that eventful period, taking care to say as little about
it as possible: and every one is so considerate as to
ask them no questions on a subject so sore to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with the daughters of Dr. Byles, the case was
quite different. They gloried,—they triumphed, in
the firm adherence of their father and his family to
the royalty of England,—and scorned the idea of even
now being classed among the <span class='it'>citoyennes</span> of a republic;
a republic which, as they said, <span class='it'>they</span> had never acknowledged,
and never would; regarding themselves
still as faithful subjects to the majesty of Britain,
whoever that majesty might be. Of the kings that
they knew of, they had a decided preference for
George the Third, as the monarch of their youthful
days, and under whom the most important events of
their lives had taken place. All since the revolution
was nearly a blank in their memories;—they dated
almost entirely from that period,—and since then,
they had acquired but a scanty accession to the number
of their ideas. From their visiters they learnt
little or nothing, as they always had the chief of the
talk to themselves. With English history, and with
the writers of the first half of the last century they
were somewhat conversant,—but all that had transpired
in the literary and political world since the
peace of ’83, was to them indistinct and shadowy
as the images of a dream not worth remembering.
But they talked of what, to us, is now the olden time
with a vividness of recollection that seemed as if the
things had occurred but yesterday. In the coloring
of their pictures, I, of course, made allowance for the
predominant tinge of toryism, and who for a large
portion of the lingering vanity, which I regarded
indulgently, because it injured no one, and their self-satisfaction
added to the happiness of these isolated
old ladies. They once showed me, in an upper room,
portraits of themselves at the ages of seventeen and
eighteen, painted by Pelham, the brother-in-law, I
believe, of Copley. The pictures were tolerably executed;
and I think they <span class='it'>must</span> have been likenesses,
for the faded faces of the octogenarian sisters still retained
some resemblance to their youthful prototypes.
The Miss Byleses were not depicted in the prevailing
costume of that period. They had neither hoop-petticoats,
stomachers, nor powdered heads,—both
were represented in a species of non-descript garments,
imagined by the painter,—and for head gear,
Miss Catharine had her own fair locks in a state of
nature,—and Miss Mary a thing like a small turban.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From their own account they must have been regarded
somewhat in the light of belles by the British
officers. They talked of walking on the Common
arm in arm with General Howe and Lord Percy:
both of whom, they said, were frequent visitors at
the house, and often took tea and spent the evening
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I imagined the heir of Northumberland, taking his
tea in the old parlour, by the old fire-place, at the old
tea-table,—entertained by the witticisms of Dr. Byles,
and the prettinesses of his daughters; who, of course,
were the envy of all the female tories of Boston, at
least of those who could not aspire to the honor of
being talked to by English noblemen. Moreover,
Lord Percy frequently ordered the band of his regiment
to play under the chesnut trees, for the gratification
of the Miss Byleses, who then, as they said,
had “God save the King” in perfection. By the bye,
I have never heard either God save the king or Rule
Britannia <span class='it'>well</span> played by an American band; though
our musicians seem to perform the Marseillaise <span class='it'>con
amore</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The venerable ladies told me that the intimacy of
their family with the principal British officers became
so well known, that in a short time they found it expedient
to close their shutters before dark, as the
lights gleaming through the parlor windows made
the house of Dr. Byles, a mark for the Americans to
fire at from their fortifications on Dorchester heights,
in the hope that every ball might destroy a red-coated
visitor. Also, that the cannon-shot, still sticking in
the tower of Brattle-street church, was aimed by the
Cambridge rebels at General Howe, who had established
his head-quarters at the old Province House.
Unpractised artillerymen as they then were, it is
difficult to believe that, if the Province House was
really their mark, they could have missed it so
widely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Miss Byleses related many anecdotes of their
father; some of which were new to me, and with
others I had long been familiar. For the benefit of
such of my readers as have not yet met with any of
these old fashioned <span class='it'>jeux d’esprit</span> I will insert a few
samples of their quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For instance, his daughters told me of the doctor
walking one day with a whig gentleman, in the vicinity
of the Common, where a division of the British
troops lay encamped. His companion pointing to
the soldiers of the crown—said—“you see there the
cause of all our evils—” “—But you cannot say that
our evils are not <span class='it'>red-dressed</span>,” remarked Dr. Byles.
“Your pun is not a good one,” observed his companion,
“you have mis-spelt the word by adding another
D.”—“Well—” replied the clerical joker,—“as a
doctor of divinity, am I not entitled to the use of two
D’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spoke of their father’s captivity in his own
mansion. And one of them repeated to me the well
known story of Dr. Byles coming out to the centinel
who was on guard, in a porch that then ran along the
front of the house, and requesting him to go to the
street pump and bring a bucket of cold water, as the
day was warm, and the doctor very thirsty. The
soldier, it seems, at first declined; alleging his reluctance
to violate the rules of the service by quitting
his post before the relief came round. The doctor
assured the man that <span class='it'>he</span> would take his place, and
be his own guard till the water was brought. The
centinel at last complied; and took the bucket and
went to the pump,—first resigning his musket to Dr.
Byles, who shouldered it in a very soldier-like manner,
and paced the porch, guarding himself till the
sentry came back,—to whom on returning his piece,
he said,—“Now my friend, you see I have been
guarded—re-guarded—and dis-regarded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Miss Byleses also referred to the anecdote of
their father having once paid his addresses to a lady
who refused him, and afterwards married the Mr.
Quincy of that time, a name which then, as now,
is frequently in Boston pronounced Quinsy. The
doctor afterwards meeting the lady, said to her jocosely,—“Your
taste in distempers must be very bad,
when it has led you to prefer the Quinsy to Byles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In front of the house was in former times a large
deep slough, that had been suffered by the municipal
authorities to remain there for several winters, with
all its inconveniences, which in wet weather rendered
it nearly impassable. One day, Dr. Byles observed
from his window that a chaise, containing two of the
select men, or regulators of the town, had been completely
arrested in its progress by sticking fast in the
thick heavy mud,—and they were both obliged to get
out, and putting their shoulders to the wheel, work
almost knee-deep in the mire before they could liberate
their vehicle. The doctor came out to his gate,
and bowing respectfully, said to them—“Gentlemen,
I have frequently represented that slough to you as a
nuisance to the street, but hitherto without any effect.
Therefore I am rejoiced to see you <span class='it'>stirring</span> in the
matter at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain fanatics who called themselves New-Lights
had become very obnoxious to the more rational part
of the community, and were regarded with much
displeasure by the orthodox churches. A woman of
this sect, who lived in the neighborhood, came in as
usual, one morning, to annoy Dr. Byles, by a long
argumentative, or rather vituperative visit. “Have
you heard the news?” asked the doctor, immediately
on the entrance of his unwelcome guest; he having
just learnt the arrival, from London, of three hundred
street lamps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She replied in the negative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then,”—resumed the doctor,—“Not less
than three hundred new lights have just arrived from
England, and the civil authorities are going immediately
to have them all put in irons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady was shocked to hear of the cruel treatment
designed for her sectarian brethren that had
just come over, and she hastened away directly, to
spread the intelligence among all her acquaintances,
in the hope, as she said, that something might be
done to prevent the infliction of so unmerited a punishment.
And the doctor congratulated himself on
the success of the jest by which he had gotten rid
of a troublesome visiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A son of Dr. Byles, that retired to Halifax, must
have probably inherited a portion of his father’s
mantle; for his sisters repeated to me one of his conundrums,
the humor of which almost atones for its
coarseness—“Why do the leaders of insurrections
resemble men that like sausages?”—“Because they
are fond of intestine broils.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Miss Byleses told me much of the scarcity of
provisions and fire-wood, throughout Boston, during
the winter of 1775, when the British and their adherents
held out the town against the Yankee rebels,
as they called them—and who had invested it every-where
on the land side, taking especial care that no
supplies should pass in. It was then that the old
North Church was torn down by order of General
Howe, that the soldiers might convert into fuel the
wood of which it was built.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the bye, Mrs. Corder, an aged and intelligent
female, living at the North end, informed me that,
when a little girl, she witnessed from her father’s
house on the opposite side of the way, the demolition
of this church; and that she was terrified at the
noise of the falling beams and of the wooden walls,
as they battered them down, and at the shouting and
swearing of the soldiers as they quarrelled over
their plunder. Nevertheless, when the work of destruction
was over, and the soldiers all gone, she and
other children of the neighborhood ran out to scramble
among the rubbish—and she found and carried
home a little wooden footstool or cricket, that had
evidently been thrown out from one of the demolished
pews. I bought of my informant (who was in indigent
circumstances) this humble and time-darkened
relic, and it is now in possession of my youngest
niece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To return to the daughters of Dr. Byles.—They
still lamented greatly over the privations endured
that winter by the British army shut up and beleaguered
in Boston; though certainly the same sufferings
were shared by all the inhabitants that
remained in the town.—And they grieved accordingly,
to think that these inconveniencies finally
compelled their English friends to take to their ships
and depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mary Byles related to me, that on one occasion
she had given to a hungry British soldier a piece
of cold pork that had been left from dinner. A few
evenings after, the same man knocked at the door,
and requested to see one of the ladies—Miss Mary
presented herself, and the grateful soldier slipped
into her hand a paper containing a small quantity of
the herb called by the whigs of that time “the detested
tea;” and which it was then scarcely possible
to obtain on any terms.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>Several years elapsed before I again was in Boston.
In the interim, I heard something of the Miss Byleses
from ladies who knew and visited them. I understood
that, at length, they had found it impossible to
prevent what they had so long dreaded, the opening
of a street that would take in their little green lawn,
their old horse-chesnut trees, and that part of their
house that stood directly across the way. For this
surrender of their property, they received from the
city an ample compensation in money; also their
house was made as good or rather better than ever
besides being new roofed and thoroughly repaired.
The despoiled sisters, though another and more comfortable
residence was offered to them during the
time of their destruction, as they termed it, steadily
persisted in remaining on their own domain during
the whole process of its dismemberment. Their
house, as they said, was cut in half; that part which
faced the end of Tremont street being taken away.
They mourned over the departure of every beam
and plank as if each was an old friend—and so they
truly were. And deep indeed was the affliction of
the aged sisters when they saw, falling beneath the
remorseless axe, their noble horse-chesnut trees
whose scattered branches, as they lay on the grass,
the old ladies declared, seemed to them like the dismembered
limbs of children. At this juncture, their
grief and indignation reached its climax; and they
excited much sympathy even among professed utilitarians.
There were many indulgent hearts in Boston
that felt as if the improvement of this part of the
city might yet have been delayed for a few short
years, till after these venerable and harmless females
should have closed their eyes for ever upon all that
could attach them to this side of the grave. And that
even if the march of public spirit should in consequence
have allowed itself to pause a little longer in
this part of its road, “neither heaven nor earth would
have grieved at the mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mary Byles, who with more sprightliness had
less strength of mind than her younger sister, never,
as the saying is, held up her head again.—Her health
and spirits declined from that time—she sunk slowly
but surely; and after lingering some months, a few
days of severe bodily suffering terminated all her
afflictions, and consigned her mortal remains to their
final resting-place beside her father. In the meantime
she had lost her nephew, Mather Brown, the
painter, who died at an advanced age in London and
who was to have been the heir of all that his aunts
possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the rest of their little wealth, the Miss
Byleses had in a sort of strong hold up stairs a chest
of old-fashioned plate, no article of which was on
any occasion used by them. Also, they retained some
rare and valuable books that had belonged to their
father, and a few curious and excellent mathematical
instruments brought by him from England, and which
the University of Harvard had vainly endeavoured
to purchase from them. Among other articles was
an immense burning-glass, said to be one of the
largest in the world, and which the old ladies kept
locked up in a closet, and carefully covered with a
thick cloth, lest, as they said, it should set the house
on fire.</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>On a subsequent visit to the metropolis of the American
east, I went to see the surviving Miss Byles;
and when I reached the accustomed place I could
scarcely recognize it. The main part of the old
house was yet standing; but the loss of one end had
given it quite a different aspect. There was no longer
the green inclosure, the fence-gate, and the narrow
path through the grass—the door opened directly
upon a brick pavement and on the dusty street. To
be sure there was a fresh-looking wooden door-step.
New tenements had been run up all about the now
noisy vicinity, which had entirely lost its air of quiet
retirement. All was now symptomatic of bustle and
business. The ancient dwelling-place of the Byles
family had ceased to be picturesque. It had been repaired
and made comfortable; but denuded of its
guardian trees there was nothing more to screen
from full view its extreme unsightliness. Above its
weather-blackened walls (which the sisters would not
allow to be painted, lest it should look <span class='it'>totally</span> unlike
itself) the new shingles of the roof seemed out of keeping—I
thought of all the poor ladies must have suffered
during the transformation of their paternal domicile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On knocking at the door, it was opened for me by
an extremely good-looking neatly dressed matron,
who conducted me into a room which I could scarcely
believe was the original old parlor. The homely antique
furniture had disappeared, and was replaced by
some very neat and convenient articles of modern form.
The floor was nicely carpeted; there were new
chairs and a new table,—a bed with white curtains
and counterpane, and window-curtains to match.—Nothing
looked familiar but the antique crown chair
and the pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found Miss Catharine Byles seated in a rocking
chair with a pillow at her back.—She looked paler,
thinner, sharper, and much older than when I last
saw her. She was no longer in a white short gown
but wore a whole gown of black merino, with a nice
white muslin collar and a regular day-cap trimmed
with black ribbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though glad to find her so much improved as to
comfort, I take shame to myself when I confess that
I felt something not unlike disappointment, at seeing
such a change in the ancient lady and her attributes.
The quaintness, and I may say the picturesqueness of
the old mansion, and its accessories, and also that of its
octogenarian mistress, seemed gone for ever. I am
sorry to acknowledge that at the moment I thought of
the French artist Lebrun, who meeting in the street
an old tattered beggar-man with long gray locks and
a venerable silver beard, was struck with the idea of
his being a capital subject for the pencil, and engaged
him to come to him next day and have his likeness
transferred to canvass. The beggar came; but thinking
that all people who sit for their pictures should look
spruce, he had bedizened himself in a very genteel suit
of Sunday clothes, with kneebuckles and silk stockings;
his face and hands nicely washed; his chin shaved
clean; and his hair dressed and powdered; the whole
man looking altogether as unpaintable as possible.—All
artists will sympathize with the disappointed
Lebrun, as he contemplated his beggar with dismay,
and exclaimed “—oh! you are spoiled!—you are
spoiled!” I suppose it is because I am a painter’s
sister, that I caught myself nearly on the point of
making a similar ejaculation on seeing the new-modelling
of Miss Catharine Byles, and her domicile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a truce with such unpardonable thoughts—Miss
Catharine recognized me at once, and seemed
very glad to see me. She soon began to talk about
her troubles, and her sorrows, and alluded in a very
affecting manner to the loss of her sister, who she
said had died of a broken heart in consequence of the
changes made in their little patrimony; having always
hoped to die, as she had lived, in her father’s house
just as he had left it—“But the worst of all,” pursued
Miss Catharine—“was the cutting down of the old
trees.—Every stroke of the axe seemed like a blow
upon our hearts. Neither of us slept a wink all that
night. Poor sister Mary; she soon fretted herself to
death. To think of our having to submit to these
dreadful changes, all at once; when for ten years
our dear father’s spectacles, were never removed
from the place in which he had last laid them down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I attempted to offer a few words of consolation to
Miss Catharine, but she wept bitterly and would not
be comforted. “Ah!”—said she—“this is one of the
consequences of living in a republic. Had we been
still under a king, he would have known nothing
about our little property, and we could have enjoyed
it in our own way as long as we lived. There
is one comfort, that not a creature in the states will
be any the better for what <span class='it'>we</span> shall leave behind us—Sister
and I have taken care of that. We have bequeathed
every article to our relations in Nova Scotia
since our nephew, poor boy, was so unfortunate as
to die before us. In all our trials it has been a great
satisfaction to us to reflect that when everything was
changing around, grace has been given us to remain
faithful to our church and king.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loyal old lady then informed me that, on his
accession to the throne, she had written a letter of
congratulation to his Britannic Majesty, William the
Fourth, whom she remembered having seen in Boston
before the revolution, when he was there as Duke of
Clarence and an officer in his father’s navy. In this
epistle she had earnestly assured him that the family
of Dr. Byles always were, and always would be,
most true and fervent in their devotion to their liege
lord and rightful sovereign the king of England.—To
have attempted to argue her out of this feeling,
the pride and solace of her declining life, would have
been cruel; and moreover entirely useless—I did not
hint to her the improbability of her letter ever having
reached the royal personage to whom it was addressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady told me that her chief occupation now
was to write serious poetry, and she gave me a copy
of some stanzas which she had recently composed.
The verses were tolerably good, and written in a
hand remarkably neat, handsome, and steady.</p>

<hr class='tbk121'/>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Catharine Byles survived her sister Miss Mary
about two years, and died of gradual decay in the
summer of 1837. Her remains repose with those of
her father and sister beneath the flooring of Trinity
Church. They left the whole of their property to
their loyalist relations in Nova Scotia, true to their
long-cherished resolution that no republican should
inherit the value of a farthing from them. The representative
of the family is said to have come to
Boston and taken possession of the bequest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is curious, as well as instructive, to contemplate
the infinite varieties of human character, and the
strange phases under which human intellect presents
itself. The peculiarities of these two sisters strikingly
evinced the lasting power of early impressions,
almost always indelible when acting upon minds that
have not been expanded by intercourse with the
world. For instance—their steadfast, gratuitous and
useless loyalty, cherished for monarchs whom they
had never seen, and who had forgotten the very existence
of Dr. Byles (if indeed they had ever remembered
it) and who, of course, neither knew nor cared
anything about his daughters; their rooted antipathy
to the republic in which they lived, and where if they
had not persisted in shutting their eyes they must
have seen everything flourishing around them; the
strict economy which induced them to deny themselves
even the comforts of life, and their willingness
to be assisted by the benevolent rather than render
themselves independent by an advantageous disposal
of their property. The almost idolatrous devotion
with which they clung to the inanimate objects that
had been familiar to them in early life, showed an
intensity of feeling which was both pitied and respected
by their friends, though reason perhaps would
not have sanctioned its entire indulgence. By living
so much alone, by visiting at no other house, by never
going out of their native town, by perpetually thinking
and talking over the occurrences of their youth,
they had wrought themselves into a firm belief that
no way was right but their own way, no opinions
correct but their own opinions: and above all, that in
no other dwelling-place but their paternal mansion
was it possible for them to be happy or even to
exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a set-off to their weaknesses, their vanities and
their prejudices, it gives me pleasure to bear testimony
to the kindness of their deportment, the soft
tones of their voices, and to the old-fashioned polish
of their manners; which at once denoted them to be
ladies, even in their short-gowns and petticoats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though, in the latter part of their lives, the
daughters of Dr. Byles were subjected to the sore
trial of seeing the little green lawn on which they
had played when children converted into a dusty
street, and the fine old trees (which would take a century
to replace) demolished in a few minutes before
their eyes: still they were both permitted to die
beneath the same roof under which their existence
had commenced. The house of their heavenly father
has many mansions; and there, in their eternal
abode, now that their mental vision has cleared,
and their souls have been purified from the dross of
mortality, they have learnt the futility of having set
their hearts too steadfastly on a dwelling erected by
human hands; and more than all, of fostering prejudices
in favor of that system of government which,
according to the signs of the times, is fast and deservedly
passing away. Is it too much to hope that
ere the lapse of another half century, not a being in
the civilized world will render the homage of a bended
knee, except to the King of Heaven.</p>

<div><h1><a id='few'></a>A FEW WORDS ABOUT BRAINARD.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY EDGAR A. POE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Among</span> all the <span class='it'>pioneers</span> of American literature,
whether prose or poetical, there is <span class='it'>not one</span> whose
productions have not been much over-rated by his
countrymen. But this fact is more especially obvious
in respect to such of these pioneers as are no longer
living,—nor is it a fact of so deeply transcendental a
nature as only to be accounted for by the Emersons
and Alcotts. In the first place, we have but to consider
that gratitude, surprise, and a species of hyper-patriotic
triumph have been blended, and finally confounded,
with mere admiration, or appreciation, in
respect to the labors of our earlier writers; and, in
the second place, that Death has thrown his customary
veil of the sacred over these commingled feelings,
forbidding them, in a measure, to be <span class='it'>now</span> separated or
subjected to analysis. “In speaking of the deceased,”
says that excellent old English Moralist, James
Puckle, in his “Gray Cap for a Green Head,” “so
fold up your discourse that their virtues may be outwardly
shown, while their vices are wrapped up in
silence.” And with somewhat too inconsiderate a
promptitude have we followed the spirit of this
quaint advice. The mass of American readers have
been, hitherto, in no frame of mind to view with calmness,
and to discuss with discrimination, the true
claims of the few who were <span class='it'>first</span> in convincing the
mother country that her sons were not all brainless,
as, in the plentitude of her arrogance, she, at one
period, half affected and half wished to believe; and
where any of these few have departed from among
us, the difficulty of bringing their pretensions to the
test of a proper criticism has been enhanced in a very
remarkable degree. But even as concerns the living:
is there any one so blind as not to see that Mr. Cooper,
for example, owes much, and that Mr. Paulding,
owes <span class='it'>all</span> of his reputation as a novelist, to his early
occupation of the field? Is there any one so dull as
not to know that fictions which neither Mr. Paulding
nor Mr. Cooper <span class='it'>could</span> have written, are daily published
by native authors without attracting more of
commendation than can be crammed into a hack
newspaper paragraph? And, again, is there any one
so prejudiced as not to acknowledge that all this is
because there is no longer either reason or wit in the
query,—“Who reads an American book?” It is not
because we lack the talent in which the days of Mr.
Paulding exulted, but because such talent has shown
itself to be common. It is not because we have <span class='it'>no</span> Mr.
Coopers; but because it has been demonstrated that
we might, at any moment, have as many Mr. Coopers
as we please. In fact we are now strong in our own
resources. We have, at length, arrived at that epoch
when our literature may and must stand on its own
merits, or fall through its own defects. We have
snapped asunder the leading-strings of our British
Grandmamma, and, better still, we have survived
the first hours of our novel freedom,—the first licentious
hours of a hobbledehoy braggadocio and swagger.
<span class='it'>At last</span>, then, we are in a condition to be criticised—even
more, to be neglected; and the journalist
is no longer in danger of being impeached for <span class='it'>lèse-majesté</span>
of the Democratic Spirit, who shall assert,
with sufficient humility, that we have committed an
error in mistaking “Kettell’s Specimens” for the
Pentateuch, or Joseph Rodman Drake for Apollo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The case of this latter gentleman is one which
well illustrates what we have been saying. We
believe it was some five years ago that Mr. Dearborn
republished the “Culprit Fay,” which then, as at the
period of its original issue, was belauded by the universal
American press, in a manner which must have
appeared ludicrous—not to speak <span class='it'>very</span> plainly—in the
eyes of all unprejudiced observers. With a curiosity
much excited by comments at once so grandiloquent
and so general, we procured and read the poem.
What we found it we ventured to express distinctly,
and at some length, in the pages of the “Southern
Messenger.” It is a well-versified and sufficiently
fluent composition, without high merit of any kind.
Its defects are gross and superabundant. Its plot and
conduct, considered in reference to its scene, are absurd.
Its originality is none at all. Its imagination
(and this was the great feature insisted upon by its
admirers,) is but a “counterfeit presentment,”—but
the shadow of the shade of that lofty quality
which is, in fact, the soul of the Poetic Sentiment—but
a drivelling <span class='it'>effort to be fanciful</span>—an effort resulting
in a species of hop-skip-and-go-merry rhodomontade,
which the uninitiated feel it a duty to call
ideality, and to admire as such, while lost in surprise
at the impossibility of performing at least the latter
half of the duty with any thing like satisfaction to
themselves. And all this we not only asserted,
but without difficulty <span class='it'>proved</span>. Dr. Drake has written
some beautiful poems, but the “Culprit Fay,” is not
of them. We neither expected to hear any dissent
from our opinions, nor did we hear any. On the
contrary, the approving voice of every critic in
the country whose <span class='it'>dictum</span> we had been accustomed
to respect, was to us a sufficient assurance that we
had not been very grossly in the wrong. In fact the
public taste was then <span class='it'>approaching</span> the right. The
truth indeed had not, as yet, made itself heard; but
we had reached a point at which it had but to be
plainly and boldly <span class='it'>put</span>, to be, at least tacitly, admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This habit of apotheosising our literary pioneers
was a most indiscriminating one. Upon <span class='it'>all</span> who
wrote, the applause was plastered with an impartiality
really refreshing. Of course, the system
favored the dunces at the expense of true merit;
and, since there existed a certain fixed standard of
exaggerated commendation to which all were adapted
after the fashion of Procrustes, it is clear that the
most meritorious required <span class='it'>the least stretching</span>,—in
other words, that, although all were much over-rated,
the deserving were over-rated in a less degree than
the unworthy. Thus with Brainard:—a man of
indisputable genius, who, in any more discriminate
system of panegyric, would have been long ago
bepuffed into Demi-Deism; for if “M’Fingal,” for
example, is in reality what we have been told, the
commentators upon Trumbull, as a matter of the
simplest consistency, should have exalted into the
seventh heaven of poetical dominion the author of
the many graceful and vigorous effusions which are
now lying, in a very neat little volume, before us.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet we maintain that even these effusions have
been overpraised, and materially so. It is not that
Brainard has not written poems which may rank
with those of any American, with the single exception
of Longfellow—but that the general merit of our
whole national Muse has been estimated too highly,
and that the author of “The Connecticut River” has,
individually, shared in the exaggeration. No poet
among us has composed what would deserve the tithe
of that amount of approbation so innocently lavished
upon Brainard. But it would not suit our purpose
just now, and in this department of the Magazine, to
enter into any elaborate analysis of his productions.
It so happens, however, that we open the book at a
brief poem, an examination of which will stand us
in good stead of this general analysis, since it is by
this very poem that the admirers of its author are
content to swear—since it is the fashion to cite it as
his best—since thus, in short, it is the chief basis of
his notoriety, if not the surest triumph of his fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We allude to “The Fall of Niagara,” and shall be
pardoned for quoting it in full.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It is a very usual thing to hear these verses called
not merely the best of their author, but the best
which have been written on the subject of Niagara.
Its positive merit appears to us only partial. We
have been informed that the poet <span class='it'>had seen</span> the great
cataract before writing the lines; but the Memoir
prefixed to the present edition, denies what, for our
own part, we never believed; for Brainard was truly
a poet, and no poet could have looked upon Niagara,
in the substance, and written thus about it. If he
saw it at all, it must have been in fancy—“at a distance”—εκας—as
the lying Pindar says he saw Archilocus,
who died ages before the villain was born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the two opening verses we have no objection;
but it may be well observed, in passing, that had the
mind of the poet been really “crowded with strange
thoughts,” and not merely <span class='it'>engaged in an endeavor
to think</span> he would have entered at once upon the
thoughts themselves, without allusion to the state of
his brain. His subject would have left him no room
for self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third line embodies an absurd, and impossible,
not to say a contemptible image. We are called
upon to conceive a similarity between the <span class='it'>continuous</span>
downward sweep of Niagara, and the momentary
splashing of some definite and of course trifling
quantity of water <span class='it'>from a hand</span>; for, although it is
the hand of the Deity himself which is referred to,
the mind is irresistibly led, by the words “poured
from his hollow hand,” to that idea which has been
<span class='it'>customarily</span> attached to such phrase. It is needless
to say, moreover, that the bestowing upon Deity a
human form, is at best a low and most unideal conception.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a>
In fact the poet has committed the grossest
of errors in <span class='it'>likening</span> the fall to <span class='it'>any</span> material object;
for the human fancy can fashion nothing which shall
not be inferior in majesty to the cataract itself. Thus
bathos is inevitable; and there is no better exemplification
of bathos than Mr. Brainard has here given.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth line but renders the matter worse, for
here the figure is most inartistically shifted. The
handful of water becomes animate; for it has a front—that
is, a forehead, and upon this forehead the
Deity proceeds to hang a bow, that is, a rainbow. At
the same time he “speaks in that loud voice, &amp;c.;”
and here it is obvious that the ideas of the writer are
in a sad state of fluctuation; for he transfers the
idiosyncrasy of the fall itself (that is to say its sound)
to the one who pours it from his hand. But not content
with all this, Mr. Brainard commands the flood
to <span class='it'>keep a kind of tally</span>; for this is the low thought
which the expression about “notching in the rocks”
immediately and inevitably induces. The whole of
this first division of the poem, embraces, we hesitate
not to say, one of the most jarring, inappropriate,
mean, and in every way monstrous assemblages of
false imagery, which can be found out of the tragedies
of Nat Lee, or the farces of Thomas Carlyle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the latter division, the poet recovers himself, as
if ashamed of his previous bombast. His natural instinct
(for Brainard was no artist) has enabled him
<span class='it'>to feel</span> that <span class='it'>subjects which surpass in grandeur all
efforts of the human imagination are well depicted
only in the simplest and least metaphorical language</span>—a
proposition as susceptible of demonstration as
any in Euclid. Accordingly, we find a material
sinking in tone; although he does not at once, discard
all imagery. The “Deep calleth unto deep” is
nevertheless a great improvement upon his previous
rhetoricianism. The personification of the waters
above and below would be good in reference to any
subject less august. The moral reflections which
immediately follow, have at least the merit of simplicity:
but the poet exhibits no very lofty imagination
when he bases these reflections only upon the cataract’s
superiority to man <span class='it'>in the noise it can create</span>;
nor is the concluding idea more spirited, where the
mere difference between the quantity of water which
occasioned the flood, and the quantity which Niagara
precipitates, is made the measure of the Almighty
Mind’s superiority to that cataract which it called by
a thought into existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But although “The Fall of Niagara” does not deserve
all the unmeaning commendation it has received,
there are, nevertheless, many truly beautiful
poems in this collection, and even more certain evidences
of poetic power. “To a Child, the Daughter of a
Friend” is exceedingly graceful and terse. “To the
Dead” has equal grace, with more vigor, and, moreover,
a touching air of melancholy. Its melody is
very rich, and in the monotonous repetition, at each
stanza, of a certain rhyme, we recognise a fantastic
yet true imagination. “Mr. Merry’s Lament for
Long Tom” would be worthy of all praise were not
its unusually beautiful rhythm an imitation from
Campbell, who would deserve his high poetical rank,
if only for its construction. Of the merely humorous
pieces we have little to say. Such things are not
<span class='it'>poetry</span>. Mr. Brainard excelled in them, and they are
very good in their place; but that place is not in a
collection of <span class='it'>poems</span>. The prevalent notions upon
this head are extremely vague; yet we see no reason
why any ambiguity should exist. Humor, with an
exception to be made hereafter, is directly antagonistical
to that which is the soul of the Muse proper;
and the omni-prevalent belief, that melancholy is inseparable
from the higher manifestations of the beautiful,
is not without a firm basis in nature and in
reason. But it so happens that humor and that
quality which we have termed the soul of the Muse
(imagination) are both essentially aided in their development
by the same adventitious assistance—that
of rhythm and of rhyme. Thus the only bond
between humorous verse and poetry, properly so
called, is that they employ in common, a certain
tool. But this single circumstance has been sufficient
to occasion, and to maintain through long ages, a
confusion of two very distinct ideas in the brain of
the unthinking critic. There is, nevertheless, an individual
branch of humor which blends so happily
with the ideal, that from the union result some of the
finest effects of legitimate poesy. We allude to
what is termed “<span class='it'>archness</span>”—a trait with which popular
feeling, which is unfailingly poetic, has invested,
for example, the whole character of the fairy. In
the volume before us there is a brief composition entitled
“The Tree Toad” which will afford a fine
exemplification of our idea. It seems to have been
hurriedly constructed, as if its author had felt
ashamed of his light labor. But that in his heart
there was a secret exultation over these verses for
which his reason found it difficult to account, <span class='it'>we
know</span>; and there is not a really imaginative man
within sound of our voice to-day, who, upon perusal
of this little “Tree Toad” will not admit it to be one
of the <span class='it'>truest poems</span> ever written by Brainard.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Barnaby Rudge; By Charles Dickens, (Boz) Author of

Twist,” etc. etc. With numerous Illustrations, by Cattermole,

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We often hear it said, of this or of that proposition, that it
may be good in theory, but will not answer in practice;
and in such assertions we find the substance of all the
sneers at Critical Art which so gracefully curl the upper lips
of a tribe which is beneath it. We mean the small geniuses—the
literary Titmice—animalculae which judge of merit
solely by <span class='it'>result</span>, and boast of the solidity, tangibility and
infallibility of the test which they employ. The worth of
a work is most accurately estimated, they assure us, by the
number of those who peruse it; and “does a book sell?”
is a query embodying, in their opinion, all that need be
said or sung on the topic of its fitness for sale. We should
as soon think of maintaining, in the presence of these
creatures, the <span class='it'>dictum</span> of Anaxagoras, that snow is black,
as of disputing, for example, the profundity of that genius
which, in a run of five hundred nights, has rendered itself
evident in “London Assurance.” “What,” cry they, “are
critical precepts to us, or to anybody? Were we to observe
all the critical rules in creation we should still be unable
to write a good book”—a point, by the way, which we shall
not now pause to deny. “Give us <span class='it'>results</span>,” they vociferate,
“for we are plain men of common sense. We contend for
fact instead of fancy—for practice in opposition to theory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mistake into which the Titmice have been innocently
led, however, is precisely that of dividing the practice
which they would uphold, from the theory to which they
would object. They should have been told in infancy, and
thus prevented from exposing themselves in old age, that
theory and practice are in so much <span class='it'>one</span>, that the former implies
or includes the latter. A theory is only good as such,
in proportion to its reducibility to practice. If the practice
fail, it is because the theory is imperfect. To say what
they are in the daily habit of saying—that such or such a
matter may be good in theory but is false in practice,—is to
perpetrate a bull—to commit a paradox—to state a contradiction
in terms—in plain words, to tell a lie <span class='it'>which is a
lie at sight</span> to the understanding of anything bigger than a
Titmouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we have no idea, just now, of persecuting the Tittlebats
by too close a scrutiny into their little opinions. It is
not our purpose, for example, to press them with so grave a
weapon as the <span class='it'>argumentum ad absurdum</span>, or to ask them
why, if the popularity of a book be in fact the measure of
its worth, we should not be at once in condition to admit
the inferiority of “Newton’s Principia” to “Hoyle’s
Games;” of “Ernest Maltravers” to “Jack-the-Giant-Killer,”
or “Jack Sheppard,” or “Jack Brag;” and of
“Dick’s Christian Philosopher” to “Charlotte Temple,”
or the “Memoirs of de Grammont,” or to one or two dozen
other works which must be nameless. Our present design
is but to speak, at some length, of a book which in so much
concerns the Titmice, that it affords them the very kind of
demonstration which they chiefly affect—<span class='it'>practical</span> demonstration—of
the fallacy of one of their favorite dogmas; we
mean the dogma that no work of fiction can fully suit, at
the same time, the critical and the popular taste; in fact,
that the disregarding or contravening of Critical Rule is
absolutely essential to success, beyond a certain and very
limited extent, with the public at large. And if, in the
course of our random observations—for we have no space
for systematic review—it should appear, incidentally, that
the vast popularity of “Barnaby Rudge” must be regarded
less as the measure of its value, than as the legitimate and
inevitable result of certain well-understood critical propositions
reduced by genius into practice, there will appear
nothing more than what has before become apparent in the
“Vicar of Wakefield” of Goldsmith, or in the “Robinson
Crusoe” of De Foe—nothing more, in fact, than what is a
truism to all but the Titmice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who know us will not, from what is here premised,
suppose it our intention, to enter into any wholesale <span class='it'>laudation</span>
of “Barnaby Rudge.” In truth, our design may appear,
at a cursory glance, to be very different indeed. Boccalini,
in his “Advertisements from Parnassus,” tells us
that a critic once presented Apollo with a severe censure
upon an excellent poem. The God asked him for the beauties
of the work. He replied that he only troubled himself about
the errors. Apollo presented him with a sack of unwinnowed
wheat, and bade him pick out all the chaff for his
pains. Now we have not fully made up our minds that the
God was in the right. We are not sure that the limit of
critical duty is not very generally misapprehended. <span class='it'>Excellence</span>
may be considered an axiom, or a proposition
which becomes self-evident just in proportion to the clearness
or precision with which it is <span class='it'>put</span>. If it fairly exists, in
this sense, it requires no farther elucidation. It is not excellence
if it need to be demonstrated as such. To point out
too particularly the beauties of a work, is to admit, tacitly,
that these beauties are not wholly admirable. Regarding,
then, excellence as that which is capable of self-manifestation,
it but remains for the critic to show when, where, and
how it fails in becoming manifest; and, in this showing, it
will be the fault of the book itself if what of beauty it contains
be not, at least, placed in the fairest light. In a word,
we may assume, notwithstanding a vast deal of pitiable
cant upon this topic, that in pointing out frankly the errors
of a work, we do nearly all that is critically necessary in
displaying its merits. In teaching what perfection <span class='it'>is</span>, how,
in fact, shall we more rationally proceed than in specifying
what it <span class='it'>is not</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plot of “Barnaby Rudge” runs thus: About a hundred
years ago, Geoffrey Haredale and John Chester were
schoolmates in England—the former being the scape-goat
and drudge of the latter. Leaving school, the boys become
friends, with much of the old understanding. Haredale
loves; Chester deprives him of his mistress. The one
cherishes the most deadly hatred; the other merely contemns
and avoids. By routes widely different both attain
mature age. Haredale, remembering his old love, and still
cherishing his old hatred, remains a bachelor and is poor.
Chester, among other crimes, is guilty of the seduction and
heartless abandonment of a gypsy-girl, who, after the desertion
of her lover, gives birth to a son, and, falling into
evil courses, is finally hung at Tyburn. The son is received
and taken charge of, at an inn called the Maypole, upon
the borders of Epping forest, and about twelve miles from
London. This inn is kept by one John Willet, a burley-headed
and very obtuse little man, who has a son, Joe, and
who employs his <span class='it'>protégé</span>, under the single name of Hugh,
as perpetual hostler at the inn. Hugh’s father marries, in
the meantime, a rich <span class='it'>parvenue</span>, who soon dies, but not before
having presented Mr. Chester with a boy, Edward.
The father, (a thoroughly selfish man-of-the-world, whose
model is Chesterfield,) educates this son at a distance, seeing
him rarely, and calling him to the paternal residence, at
London, only when he has attained the age of twenty-four
or five. He, the father, has, long ere this time, spent the
fortune brought him by his wife, having been living upon his
wits and a small annuity for some eighteen years. The son
is recalled chiefly that by marrying an heiress, on the
strength of his own personal merit and the reputed wealth
of old Chester, he may enable the latter to continue his
gayeties in old age. But of this design, as well as of his
poverty, Edward is kept in ignorance for some three or four
years after his recall; when the father’s discovery of what
he considers an inexpedient love-entanglement on the part
of the son, induces him to disclose the true state of his
affairs, as well as the real tenor of his intentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the love-entanglement of which we speak, is considered
inexpedient by Mr. Chester for two reasons—the
first of which is, that the lady beloved is the orphan niece
of his old enemy, Haredale, and the second is, that Haredale
(although in circumstances which have been much
and very unexpectedly improved during the preceding
twenty-two years) is still insufficiently wealthy to meet the
views of Mr. Chester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We say that, about twenty-two years before the period
in question, there came an unlooked-for change in the
worldly circumstances of Haredale. This gentleman has
an elder brother, Reuben, who has long possessed the
family inheritance of the Haredales, residing at a mansion
called “The Warren,” not far from the Maypole-Inn,
which is itself a portion of the estate. Reuben <span class='it'>is a widower</span>,
with one child, a daughter, Emma. Besides this daughter,
there are living with him a gardener, a steward (whose
name is Rudge) and <span class='it'>two</span> women servants, one of whom is
the wife of Rudge. On the night of the nineteenth of March,
1733, Rudge murders his master for the sake of a large
sum of money which he is known to have in possession.
During the struggle, Mr. Haredale grasps the cord of an
alarm-bell which hangs within his reach, but succeeds in
sounding it only once or twice, when it is severed by the
knife of the ruffian, who then, completing his bloody business,
and securing the money, proceeds to quit the chamber.
While doing this, however, he is disconcerted by
meeting the gardener, whose pallid countenance evinces
suspicion of the deed committed. The murderer is thus
forced to kill his fellow servant. Having done so, the idea
strikes him of transferring the burden of the crime from
himself. He dresses the corpse of the gardener in his own
clothes, puts upon its finger his own ring and in its pocket
his own watch—then drags it to a pond in the grounds, and
throws it in. He now returns to the house, and, disclosing
all to his wife, requests her to become a partner in his
flight. Horror-stricken, she falls to the ground. He attempts
to raise her. She seizes his wrist, <span class='it'>staining her hand with
blood in the attempt</span>. She renounces him forever; yet
promises to conceal the crime. Alone, he flees the country.
The next morning, Mr. Haredale being found murdered, and
the steward and gardener being both missing, both are suspected.
Mrs. Rudge leaves The Warren, and retires to an
obscure lodging in London (where she lives upon an annuity
allowed her by Haredale) having given birth, <span class='it'>on the very
day after the murder</span>, to a son, Barnaby Rudge, who proves
an idiot, who bears upon his wrist a red mark, and who is
born possessed with a maniacal horror of blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some months since the assassination having elapsed,
what appears to be the corpse of Rudge is discovered, and
the outrage is attributed to the gardener. Yet not universally:—for,
as Geoffrey Haredale comes into possession of
the estate, there are not wanting suspicions (fomented by
Chester) of his own participation in the deed. This taint
of suspicion, acting upon his hereditary gloom, together
with the natural grief and horror of the atrocity, embitters
the whole life of Haredale. He secludes himself at The
Warren, and acquires a monomaniac acerbity of temper
relieved only by love of his beautiful niece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time wears away. Twenty-two years pass by. The
niece has ripened into womanhood, and loves young Chester
without the knowledge of her uncle or the youth’s father.
Hugh has grown a stalwart man—the type of man <span class='it'>the
animal</span>, as his father is of man the ultra-civilized. Rudge,
the murderer, returns, urged to his undoing by Fate. He appears
at the Maypole and inquires stealthily of the circumstances
which have occurred at The Warren in his absence.
He proceeds to London, discovers the dwelling of his wife,
threatens her with the betrayal of her idiot son into vice and
extorts from her the bounty of Haredale. Revolting at such
appropriation of such means, the widow, with Barnaby,
again seeks The Warren, renounces the annuity, and, refusing
to assign any reason for her conduct, states her intention
of quitting London forever, and of burying herself
in some obscure retreat—a retreat which she begs Haredale
not to attempt discovering. When he seeks her in London
the next day, she is gone; and there are no tidings, either
of herself or of Barnaby, <span class='it'>until the expiration of five years</span>—which
bring the time up to that of the Celebrated “No
Popery” Riots of Lord George Gordon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile, and immediately subsequent to the re-appearance
of Rudge; Haredale and the elder Chester,
each heartily desirous of preventing the union of Edward
and Emma, have entered into a covenant, the result of
which is that, by means of treachery on the part of Chester,
permitted on that of Haredale, the lovers misunderstand
each other and are estranged. Joe, also, the son of the
innkeeper, Willet, having been coquetted with, to too great
an extent, by Dolly Varden, (the pretty daughter of one
Gabriel Varden, a locksmith of Clerkenwell, London) and
having been otherwise mal-treated at home, enlists in his
Majesty’s army and is carried beyond seas, to America;
not returning until towards the close of the riots. Just
before their commencement, Rudge, in a midnight prowl
about the scene of his atrocity, is encountered by an individual
who had been familiar with him in earlier life,
while living at The Warren. This individual, terrified at
what he supposes, very naturally, to be the ghost of the
murdered Rudge, relates his adventure to his companions
at the Maypole, and John Willet conveys the intelligence,
forthwith, to Mr. Haredale. Connecting the apparition, in
his own mind, with the peculiar conduct of Mrs. Rudge,
this gentleman imbibes a suspicion, at once, of the true
state of affairs. This suspicion (which he mentions to no
one) is, moreover, very strongly confirmed by an occurrence
happening to Varden, the locksmith, who, visiting the woman
late one night, finds her in communion of a nature apparently
most confidential, with a ruffian whom the locksmith
knows to be such, without knowing the man himself. Upon
an attempt, on the part of Varden, to seize this ruffian, he
is thwarted by Mrs. R.; and upon Haredale’s inquiring
minutely into the personal appearance of the man, he is
found to accord with Rudge. We have already shown that
the ruffian was in fact Rudge himself. Acting upon the
suspicion thus aroused, Haredale watches, by night, alone,
in the deserted house formerly occupied by Mrs. R. in hope
of here coming upon the murderer, and makes other exertions
with the view of arresting him; but all in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, also, at the conclusion <span class='it'>of the five years</span>, that the
hitherto uninvaded retreat of Mrs. Rudge is disturbed by
a message from her husband, demanding money. He has
discovered her abode by accident. Giving him what she has
at the time, she afterwards eludes him, and hastens, with
Barnaby, to bury herself in the crowd of London, until she
can find opportunity again to seek retreat in some more
distant region of England. But the riots have now begun.
The idiot is beguiled into joining the mob, and, becoming
separated from his mother (who, growing ill through grief,
is borne to a hospital) meets with his old playmate Hugh,
and becomes with him a ringleader in the rebellion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The riots proceed. A conspicuous part is borne in them
by one Simon Tappertit, a fantastic and conceited little
apprentice of Varden’s, and a sworn enemy to Joe Willet,
who has rivalled him in the affection of Dolly. A hangman,
Dennis, is also very busy amid the mob. Lord
George Gordon, and his secretary, Gashford, with John
Grueby, his servant, appear, of course, upon the scene.
Old Chester, who, during the five years, has become Sir
John, instigates Gashford, who has received personal insult
from Haredale, (a catholic and consequently obnoxious to
the mob) instigates Gashford to procure the burning of The
Warren, and to abduct Emma during the excitement ensuing.
The mansion is burned, (Hugh, who also fancies
himself wronged by Haredale, being chief actor in the outrage)
and Miss H. carried off, in company with Dolly, who
had long lived with her, and whom Tappertit abducts upon
his own responsibility. Rudge, in the meantime, finding
the eye of Haredale upon him, (since he has become aware
of the watch kept nightly at his wife’s,) goaded by the dread
of solitude, and fancying that his sole chance of safety lies
in joining the rioters, hurries upon their track to the doomed
Warren. He arrives too late—the mob have departed.
Skulking about the ruins, he is discovered by Haredale,
and finally captured, without a struggle, within the glowing
walls of the very chamber in which the deed was committed.
He is conveyed to prison, where he meets and
recognises Barnaby, who had been captured as a rioter.
The mob assail and burn the jail. The father and son
escape. Betrayed by Dennis, both are again retaken, and
Hugh shares their fate. In Newgate, Dennis, through accident,
discovers the parentage of Hugh, and an effort is
made in vain to interest Chester in behalf of his son. Finally,
Varden procures the pardon of Barnaby; but Hugh,
Rudge and Dennis are hung. At the eleventh hour, Joe
returns from abroad with one arm. In company with Edward
Chester, he performs prodigies of valor (during the
last riots) on behalf of the government. The two, with
Haredale and Varden, rescue Emma and Dolly. A double
marriage, of course, takes place; for Dolly has repented
her fine airs, and the prejudices of Haredale are overcome.
Having killed Chester in a duel, he quits England forever,
and ends his days in the seclusion of an Italian convent.
Thus, after summary disposal of the understrappers, ends
the drama of “Barnaby Rudge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have given, as may well be supposed, but a very
meagre outline of the story, and we have given it in the
simple or natural sequence. That is to say, we have related
the events, as nearly as might be, in the order of their
occurrence. But this order would by no means have suited
the purpose of the novelist, whose design has been to maintain
the secret of the murder, and the consequent mystery
which encircles Rudge, and the actions of his wife, until
the catastrophe of his discovery by Haredale. The <span class='it'>thesis</span>
of the novel may thus be regarded as based upon curiosity.
Every point is so arranged as to perplex the reader, and
whet his desire for elucidation:—for example, the first appearance
of Rudge at the Maypole; his questions; his
persecution of Mrs. R.; the ghost seen by the frequenter of
the Maypole; and Haredale’s impressive conduct in consequence.
What <span class='it'>we</span> have told, in the very beginning of
our digest, in regard to the shifting of the gardener’s dress,
is sedulously kept from the reader’s knowledge until he
learns it from Rudge’s own confession in jail. We say
sedulously; for, <span class='it'>the intention once known</span>, the <span class='it'>traces</span> of the
design can be found upon every page. There is an amusing
and exceedingly ingenious instance at page 145, where
Solomon Daisy describes his adventure with the ghost.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a ghost—a spirit,” cried Daisy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose?” they all three asked together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the excess of his emotion (for he fell back trembling in
his chair and waved his hand as if entreating them to
question him no farther) <span class='it'>his answer was lost upon all</span> but
old John Willet, who happened to be seated close beside
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who!” cried Parkes and Tom Cobb—“Who was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Willet, after a long pause, “you
needn’t ask. The likeness of a murdered man. This is the
nineteenth of March.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A profound silence ensued.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The impression here skilfully conveyed is, that the
ghost seen is that of Reuben Haredale; and the mind of the
not-too-acute reader is at once averted from the true state
of the case—from the murderer, Rudge, living in the body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now there can be no question that, by such means as
these, many points which are comparatively insipid in the
natural sequence of our digest, and which would have been
comparatively insipid even if given in full detail in a natural
sequence, are endued with the interest of mystery;
but neither can it be denied that a vast many more points
are at the same time deprived of all effect, and become
null, through the impossibility of comprehending them without
the key. The author, who, cognizant of his plot, writes
with this cognizance continually operating upon him, and
thus <span class='it'>writes to himself</span> in spite of himself, does not, of
course, feel that much of what is effective to his own informed
perception, must necessarily be lost upon his uninformed
readers; and he himself is never in condition, as
regards his own work, to bring the matter to test. But the
reader may easily satisfy himself of the validity of our objection.
Let him <span class='it'>re-peruse</span> “Barnaby Rudge,” and, with
a pre-comprehension of the mystery, these points of which
we speak break out in all directions like stars, and throw
quadruple brilliance over the narrative—a brilliance which
a correct taste will at once declare unprofitably sacrificed
at the shrine of the keenest interest of mere mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The design of <span class='it'>mystery</span>, however, being once determined
upon by an author, it becomes imperative, first, that no
undue or inartistical means be employed to conceal the
secret of the plot; and, secondly, that the secret be well
kept. Now, when, at page 16, we read that “the body of
<span class='it'>poor Mr. Rudge, the steward, was found</span>” months after the
outrage, &amp;c. we see that Mr. Dickens has been guilty of no
misdemeanor against Art in stating what was not the fact;
since the falsehood is put into the mouth of Solomon Daisy,
and given merely as the impression of this individual and
of the public. The writer has not asserted it in his own
person, but ingeniously conveyed an idea (false in itself, yet
a belief in which is necessary for the effect of the tale) by
the mouth of one of his characters. The case is different,
however, when Mrs. Rudge is repeatedly denominated “the
widow.” It is the author who, himself, frequently so terms
her. This is disingenuous and inartistical: accidentally so,
of course. We speak of the matter merely by way of
illustrating our point, and as an oversight on the part of Mr.
Dickens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the secret be well kept is obviously necessary. A
failure to preserve it until the proper moment of <span class='it'>dénouement</span>,
throws all into confusion, so far as regards the <span class='it'>effect</span> intended.
If the mystery leak out, against the author’s will,
his purposes are immediately at odds and ends; for he proceeds
upon the supposition that certain impressions <span class='it'>do</span> exist,
which do <span class='it'>not</span> exist, in the mind of his readers. We are
not prepared to say, so positively as we could wish, whether,
by the public at large, the whole <span class='it'>mystery</span> of the murder
committed by Rudge, with the identity of the Maypole
ruffian with Rudge himself, was fathomed at any period
previous to the period intended, or, if so, whether at a period
so early as materially to interfere with the interest designed;
but we are forced, through sheer modesty, to suppose
this the case; since, by ourselves individually, the
secret was distinctly understood immediately upon the
perusal of the story of Solomon Daisy, which occurs at the
seventh page of this volume of three hundred and twenty-three.
In the number of the “Philadelphia Saturday Evening
Post,” for May the 1st, 1841, (the tale having then
only begun) will be found a <span class='it'>prospective notice</span> of some length,
in which we made use of the following words⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>That Barnaby is the son of the murderer may not appear
evident to our readers—but we will explain. The person murdered
is Mr. Reuben Haredale. He was found assassinated
in his bed-chamber. His steward (Mr. Rudge, senior,) and
his gardener (name not mentioned) are missing. At first both
are suspected. ‘Some months afterward,’ here we use the
words of the story—‘the steward’s body, scarcely to be recognised
but by his clothes, and the watch and ring he wore—was
found at the bottom of a piece of water in the grounds,
with a deep gash in the breast where he had been stabbed
by a knife. He was only partly dressed; and all people
agreed that he had been sitting up reading in his own room,
where there were many traces of blood, and was suddenly
fallen upon and killed, before his master.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, be it observed, it is not the author himself who
asserts that <span class='it'>the steward’s body was found</span>; he has put the
words in the mouth of one of his characters. His design is
to make it appear, in the <span class='it'>dénouement</span>, that the steward,
Rudge, first murdered the gardener, then went to his master’s
chamber, murdered <span class='it'>him</span>, was interrupted by his
(Rudge’s) wife, whom he seized and held <span class='it'>by the wrist</span>, to
prevent her giving the alarm—that he then, after possessing
himself of the booty desired, returned to the gardener’s
room, exchanged clothes with him, put upon the corpse his
own watch and ring, and secreted it where it was afterwards
discovered at so late a period that the features could
not be identified.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The differences between our pre-conceived ideas, as
here stated, and the actual facts of the story, will be
found immaterial. The gardener was murdered not before
but after his master; and that Rudge’s wife seized
<span class='it'>him</span> by the wrist, instead of his seizing <span class='it'>her</span>, has so much
the air of a mistake on the part of Mr. Dickens, that we can
scarcely speak of our own version as erroneous. The grasp
of a murderer’s bloody hand on the wrist of a woman <span class='it'>enceinte</span>,
would have been more likely to produce the effect
described (and this every one will allow) than the grasp of
the hand of the woman upon the wrist of the assassin. We
may therefore say of our supposition as Talleyrand said of
some cockney’s bad French—<span class='it'>que s’il ne soit pas Français,
assurément donc il le doit être</span>—that if we did not rightly
prophesy, yet, at least, our prophecy <span class='it'>should have been</span> right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are informed in the Preface to “Barnaby Rudge”
that “no account of the Gordon Riots having been introduced
into any work of fiction, and the subject presenting
very extraordinary and remarkable features,” our author
“was led to project this tale.” But for this distinct announcement
(for Mr. Dickens can scarcely have deceived
himself) we should have looked upon the Riots as altogether
an afterthought. It is evident that they have no
necessary connection with the story. In our digest, which
carefully includes all <span class='it'>essentials</span> of the plot, we have dismissed
the doings of the mob in a paragraph. The whole
event of the drama would have proceeded as well without
as with them. They have even the appearance of being
<span class='it'>forcibly</span> introduced. In our compendium above, it will be
seen that we emphasised several allusions to an interval of
<span class='it'>five years</span>. The action is brought up to a certain point.
The train of events is, so far, uninterrupted—nor is there
any apparent need of interruption—yet all the characters
are now thrown forward for a period of <span class='it'>five years</span>. And
why? We ask in vain. It is not to bestow upon the lovers
a more decorous maturity of age—for this is the only possible
idea which suggests itself—Edward Chester is already
eight-and-twenty, and Emma Haredale would, in America
at least, be upon the list of old maids. No—there is no
such reason; nor does there appear to be any one more
plausible than that, as it is now the year of our Lord 1775,
an advance of five years will bring the <span class='it'>dramatis personae</span>
up to a very remarkable period, affording an admirable opportunity
for their display—the period, in short, of the “No
Popery” riots. This was the idea with which we were
forcibly impressed in perusal, and which nothing less than
Mr. Dickens’ positive assurance to the contrary would have
been sufficient to eradicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, perhaps, but one of a thousand instances of the disadvantages,
both to the author and the public, of the present
absurd fashion of periodical novel-writing, that our
author had not sufficiently considered or determined upon
<span class='it'>any</span> particular plot when he began the story now under
review. In fact, we see, or fancy that we see, numerous
traces of indecision—traces which a dexterous supervision
of the complete work might have enabled him to erase. We
have already spoken of the intermission of a lustrum. The
opening speeches of old Chester are by far too <span class='it'>truly</span> gentlemanly
for his subsequent character. The wife of Varden,
also, is too wholesale a shrew to be converted into the quiet
wife—the original design was to punish her. At page 16,
we read thus—Solomon Daisy is telling his story:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I put as good a face upon it as I could, and, muffling
myself up, started out with a lighted lantern in one hand
and the key of the church in the other”—at this point of the
narrative, the dress of the strange man rustled as if he had
turned to hear more distinctly.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here the design is to call the reader’s attention to a <span class='it'>point</span>
in the tale; but no subsequent explanation is made. Again,
a few lines below⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The houses were all shut up, and the folks in doors,
and perhaps there is only one man in the world who knows
how dark it really was.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here the intention is still more evident, but there is no
result. Again, at page 54, the idiot draws Mr. Chester to
the window, and directs his attention to the clothes hanging
upon the lines in the yard⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Look down,” he said softly; “do you mark how they
whisper in each other’s ears, then dance and leap to make
believe they are in sport? Do you see how they stop for a
moment, when they think there is no one looking, and mutter
among themselves again; and then how they roll and
gambol, delighted with the mischief they’ve been plotting?
Look at ’em now! See how they whirl and plunge. And
now they stop again, and whisper cautiously together—little
thinking, mind, how often I have lain upon the ground
and watched them. I say—what is it that they plot and
hatch? Do you know?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Upon perusal of these ravings we, at once, supposed
them to have allusion to some <span class='it'>real</span> plotting; and even now
we cannot force ourselves to believe them not so intended.
They suggested the opinion that Haredale himself would
be implicated in the murder, and that the counsellings
alluded to might be those of that gentleman with Rudge.
It is by no means impossible that some such conception
wavered in the mind of the author. At page 32 we have
a confirmation of our idea, when Varden endeavors to
arrest the murderer in the house of his wife⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back—come back!” exclaimed the woman,
wrestling with and clasping him. “Do not touch him on
your life. <span class='it'>He carries other lives beside his own.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>dénouement</span> fails to account for this exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the beginning of the story much emphasis is placed
upon the <span class='it'>two</span> female servants of Haredale, and upon his
journey to and from London, as well as upon his wife. We
have merely said, in our digest, that he was a widower,
italicizing the remark. All these other points are, in fact,
singularly irrelevant, in the supposition that the original
design has not undergone modification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, at page 57, when Haredale talks of “his dismantled
and beggared hearth,” we cannot help fancying
that the author had in view some different wrong, or series
of wrongs, perpetrated by Chester, than any which appear
in the end. This gentleman, too, takes extreme and frequent
pains to acquire dominion over the rough Hugh—this
matter is particularly insisted upon by the novelist—we
look, of course, for some important result—but the filching
of a letter is nearly all that is accomplished. That Barnaby’s
delight in the desperate scenes of the rebellion, is inconsistent
with his horror of blood, will strike every reader;
and this inconsistency seems to be the consequence of the
<span class='it'>afterthought</span> upon which we have already commented. In
fact the title of the work, the elaborate and pointed manner
of the commencement, the impressive description of The
Warren, and especially of Mrs. Rudge, go far to show that
Mr. Dickens has really deceived himself—that the soul of
the plot, as originally conceived, was the murder of Haredale
with the subsequent discovery of the murderer in
Rudge—but that this idea was afterwards abandoned,
or rather suffered to be merged in that of the Popish
Riots. The result has been most unfavorable. That which,
of itself would have proved highly effective, has been rendered
nearly null by its situation. In the multitudinous
outrage and horror of the Rebellion, the <span class='it'>one</span> atrocity is
utterly whelmed and extinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reasons of this deflection from the first purpose appear
to us self-evident. One of them we have already mentioned.
The other is that our author discovered, when too
late, that <span class='it'>he had anticipated, and thus rendered valueless,
his chief effect</span>. This will be readily understood. The
particulars of the assassination being withheld, the strength
of the narrator is put forth, in the beginning of the story, to
<span class='it'>whet curiosity</span> in respect to these particulars; and, so far,
he is but in proper pursuance of his main design. But from
this intention he unwittingly passes into the error of <span class='it'>exaggerating
anticipation</span>. And error though it be, it is an
error wrought with consummate skill. What, for example,
could more vividly enhance our impression of the unknown
horror enacted, than the deep and enduring gloom of Haredale—than
the idiot’s inborn awe of blood—or, especially,
than the expression of countenance so imaginatively attributed
to Mrs. Rudge—“the capacity for expressing terror—something
only dimly seen, but never absent for a moment—the
shadow of some look to which an instant of intense
and most unutterable horror only could have given
rise?” But it is a condition of the human fancy that the
promises of such words are irredeemable. In the notice
before mentioned we thus spoke upon this topic⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>This is a conception admirably adapted to whet curiosity
in respect to the character of that event which is hinted
at as forming the basis of the story. But this observation
should not fail to be made—that the anticipation must
surpass the reality; that no matter how terrific be the circumstances
which, in the <span class='it'>dénouement</span>, shall appear to have
occasioned the expression of countenance worn habitually
by Mrs. Rudge, still they will not be able to satisfy the
mind of the reader. He will surely be disappointed. The
skilful intimation of horror held out by the artist, produces
an effect which will deprive his conclusion of all. These
intimations—these dark hints of some uncertain evil—are
often rhetorically praised as effective—but are only justly
so praised where there is <span class='it'>no dénouement</span> whatever—where
the reader’s imagination is left to clear up the mystery for
itself—and this is not the design of Mr. Dickens.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And, in fact, our author was not long in seeing his precipitancy.
He had placed himself in a dilemma from which
even his high genius could not extricate him. He at once
shifts the main interest—and in truth we do not see what
better he could have done. The reader’s attention becomes
absorbed in the riots, and he fails to observe that what
should have been the true catastrophe of the novel, is exceedingly
feeble and ineffective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few cursory remarks:—Mr. Dickens fails peculiarly in
<span class='it'>pure</span> narration. See, for example, page 296, where the
connection of Hugh and Chester is detailed by Varden.
See also in “The Curiosity-Shop,” where, when the result
is fully known, so many words are occupied in explaining
the relationship of the brothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effect of the present narrative might have been materially
increased by confining the action within the limits
of London. The “Notre Dame” of Hugo affords a fine
example of the force which can be gained by concentration,
or unity of place. The unity of time is also sadly neglected,
to no purpose, in “Barnaby Rudge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Rudge should so long and so deeply feel the sting
of conscience is inconsistent with his brutality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On page 15 the interval elapsing between the murder
and Rudge’s return, is variously stated at twenty-two and
twenty-four years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be asked why the inmates of The Warren failed to
hear the alarm-bell which was heard by Solomon Daisy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of persecution by being tracked, as by bloodhounds,
from one spot of quietude to another is a favorite
one with Mr. Dickens. Its effect cannot be denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stain upon Barnaby’s wrist, caused by fright in the
mother at so late a period of gestation as one day before
mature parturition, is shockingly at war with all medical
experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Rudge, escaped from prison, unshackled, with
money at command, is in agony at his wife’s refusal to perjure
herself for his salvation—is it not <span class='it'>queer</span> that he should
demand any other salvation than lay in his heels?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the conclusions of chapters—see pages 40 and
100—seem to have been written for the mere purpose of
illustrating tail-pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leading idiosyncrasy of Mr. Dickens’ remarkable
humor, is to be found in his <span class='it'>translating the language of
gesture, or action, or tone</span>. For example⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The cronies nodded to each other, and Mr. Parkes
remarked in an under tone, shaking his head meanwhile,
<span class='it'>as who should say ‘let no man contradict me, for I won’t
believe him,’</span> that Willet was in amazing force to-night.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The riots form a series of vivid pictures never surpassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At page 17, the road between London and the Maypole
is described as a horribly rough and dangerous, and at page
97, as an uncommonly smooth and convenient one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At page 116, how comes Chester in possession of the
key of Mrs. Rudge’s vacated house?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dickens’ English is usually pure. His most remarkable
error is that of employing the adverb “directly” in
the sense of “as soon as.” For example—“Directly he
arrived, Rudge said, &amp;c.” Bulwer is uniformly guilty of
the same blunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is observable that so original a stylist as our author
should occasionally lapse into a gross imitation of what,
itself, is a gross imitation. We mean the manner of Lamb—a
manner based in the Latin construction. For example⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>In summer time its pumps suggest to thirsty idlers springs
cooler and more sparkling and deeper than other wells;
and as they trace the spillings of full pitchers on the heated
ground, they snuff the freshness, and, sighing, cast sad
looks towards the Thames, and think of baths and boats,
and saunter on, despondent.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The wood-cut <span class='it'>designs</span> which accompany the edition before
us are occasionally good. The copper engravings are
pitiably ill-conceived and ill-drawn; and not only this, but
are in broad contradiction of the wood-designs and text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many <span class='it'>coincidences</span> wrought into the narrative—those,
for example, which relate to the nineteenth of
March; the dream of Barnaby, respecting his father, at the
very period when his father is actually in the house; and
the dream of Haredale previous to his final meeting with
Chester. These things are meant to <span class='it'>insinuate</span> a fatality
which, very properly, is not expressed in plain terms—but
it is questionable whether the story derives more, in
ideality, from their introduction, than it might have gained
of verisimilitude from their omission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>dramatis personae</span> sustain the high fame of Mr.
Dickens as a delineator of character. Miggs, the disconsolate
handmaiden of Varden; Tappertit, his chivalrous
apprentice; Mrs. Varden, herself; and Dennis, a hangman—may
be regarded as original caricatures, of the highest
merit as such. Their traits are founded in acute observation
of nature, but are exaggerated to the utmost admissible
extent. Miss Haredale and Edward Chester are common-places—no
effort has been made in their behalf. Joe Willet
is a naturally drawn country youth. Stagg is a mere make-weight.
Gashford and Gordon are truthfully copied. Dolly
Varden is truth itself. Haredale, Rudge and Mrs. Rudge
are impressive only through the circumstances which surround
them. Sir John Chester is, of course, not original,
but is a vast improvement upon all his predecessors—his
heartlessness is rendered somewhat too amusing, and his
end too much that of a man of honor. Hugh is a noble conception.
His fierce exultation in his animal powers; his
subserviency to the smooth Chester; his mirthful contempt
and patronage of Tappertit, and his <span class='it'>brutal</span> yet firm courage
in the hour of death—form a picture to be set in diamonds.
Old Willet is not surpassed by any character even
among those of Dickens. He is nature itself—yet a step
farther would have placed him in the class of caricatures.
His combined conceit and obtusity are indescribably droll,
and his peculiar misdirected energy when aroused, is one
of the most exquisite touches in all humorous painting. We
shall never forget how heartily we laughed at his shaking
Solomon Daisy and threatening to put him behind the fire,
because the unfortunate little man was too much frightened
to articulate. Varden is one of those free, jovial, honest
fellows at charity with all mankind, whom our author is so
fond of depicting. And lastly, Barnaby, the hero of the tale—in
him we have been somewhat disappointed. We have
already said that his delight in the atrocities of the Rebellion
is at variance with his horror of blood. But this
horror of blood is <span class='it'>inconsequential</span>; and of this we complain.
Strongly insisted upon in the beginning of the narrative, it
produces no adequate result. And here how fine an opportunity
has Mr. Dickens missed! The conviction of the assassin,
after the lapse of twenty-two years, might easily
have been brought about through his son’s mysterious awe
of blood—<span class='it'>an awe created in the unborn by the assassination
itself</span>—and this would have been one of the finest possible
embodiments of the idea which we are accustomed to attach
to “poetical justice.” The raven, too, intensely amusing
as it is, might have been made, more than we now see it, a
portion of the conception of the fantastic Barnaby. Its
croakings might have been <span class='it'>prophetically</span> heard in the course
of the drama. Its character might have performed, in regard
to that of the idiot, much the same part as does, in
music, the accompaniment in respect to the air. Each
might have been distinct. Each might have differed remarkably
from the other. Yet between them there might
have been wrought an analogical resemblance, and, although
each might have existed apart, they might have formed together
a whole which would have been imperfect in the
absence of either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From what we have here said—and, perhaps, said without
due deliberation—(for alas! the hurried duties of the
journalist preclude it) there will not be wanting those who
will accuse us of a mad design to detract from the pure
fame of the novelist. But to such we merely say in the
language of heraldry “ye should wear a plain point
sanguine in your arms.” If this be understood, well; if
not, well again. There lives no man feeling a deeper reverence
for genius than ourself. If we have not dwelt so
especially upon the high merits as upon the trivial defects of
“Barnaby Rudge” we have already given our reasons for
the omission, and these reasons will be sufficiently understood
by all whom we care to understand them. The work
before us is not, we think, equal to the tale which immediately
preceded it; but there are few—very few others to
which we consider it inferior. Our chief objection has not,
perhaps, been so distinctly stated as we could wish. That
this fiction, or indeed that any fiction written by Mr.
Dickens, should be based in the excitement and maintenance
of curiosity we look upon as a misconception, on the part
of the writer, of his own very great yet very peculiar
powers. He has done this thing well, to be sure—he would
do anything well in comparison with the herd of his contemporaries—but
he has not done it so thoroughly well as
his high and just reputation would demand. We think that
the whole book has been an effort to him—solely through
the nature of its design. He has been smitten with an untimely
desire for a novel path. The idiosyncrasy of his
intellect would lead him, naturally, into the most fluent and
simple style of narration. In tales of ordinary sequence he
may and will long reign triumphant. He has a <span class='it'>talent</span> for
all things, but no positive <span class='it'>genius</span> for <span class='it'>adaptation</span>, and still
less for that metaphysical art in which the souls of all
<span class='it'>mysteries</span> lie. “Caleb Williams” is a far less noble work
than “The Old Curiosity-Shop;” but Mr. Dickens could
no more have constructed the one than Mr. Godwin could
have dreamed of the other.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Wakondah; The Master of Life. A Poem. George L.
Curry and Co.: New York.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Wakondah” is the composition of Mr. Cornelius
Mathews, one of the editors of the Monthly Magazine,
“Arcturus.” In the December number of the journal, the
poem was originally set forth by its author, very much
“<span class='it'>avec l’air d’un homme qui sauve sa patrie</span>.” To be sure, it
was not what is usually termed the <span class='it'>leading</span> article of the
month. It did not occupy that post of honor which, hitherto,
has been so modestly filled by “Puffer Hopkins.” But it took
precedence of some exceedingly beautiful stanzas by Professor
Longfellow, and stood second only to a very serious
account of a supper which, however well it might have suited
the taste of an Ariel, would scarcely have feasted the Anakim,
or satisfied the appetite of a Grandgousier. The supper
was, or might have been, a good thing. The poem which
succeeded it <span class='it'>is not</span>; nor can we imagine what has induced
Messrs. Curry &amp; Co. to be at the trouble of its republication.
We are vexed with these gentlemen for having thrust
this affair the second time before us. They have placed us
in a predicament we dislike. In the pages of “Arcturus” the
poem did not come necessarily under the eye of the Magazine
critic. There is a tacitly-understood courtesy about
these matters—a courtesy upon which we need not comment.
The contributed papers in any one journal of the
class of “Arcturus” are not considered as <span class='it'>debateable</span> by any
one other. General propositions, under the editorial head,
are rightly made the subject of discussion; but in speaking
of “Wakondah,” for example, in the pages of our own
Magazine, we should have felt as if <span class='it'>making an occasion</span>.
Now, upon our first perusal of the poem in question, we
were both astonished and grieved that we could say,
honestly, very little in its praise:—astonished, for by some
means, not just now altogether intelligible to ourselves, we
had become imbued with the idea of high poetical talent in
Mr. Mathews:—grieved, because, under the circumstances
of his position as editor of one of the <span class='it'>very</span> best journals in
the country, we had been sincerely anxious to think well of
his abilities. Moreover, we felt that to <span class='it'>speak ill</span> of them,
under any circumstances whatever, would be to subject
ourselves to the charge of envy or jealousy, on the part of
those who do not personally know us. We, therefore,
rejoiced that “Wakondah” was not a topic we were called
upon to discuss. But the poem is republished, and placed
upon our table, and these very “circumstances of position,”
which restrained us in the first place, render it a positive
duty that we speak distinctly in the second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And very distinctly shall we speak. In fact this effusion is
a dilemma whose horns <span class='it'>goad</span> us into frankness and candor—“<span class='it'>c’est
un malheur</span>,” to use the words of Victor Hugo,
“<span class='it'>d’où on ne pourrait se tirer par des periphrases, par des
quemadmodums et des verumenimveros</span>.” If we mention it
at all, we are <span class='it'>forced</span> to employ the language of that region
where, as Addison has it, “they sell the best fish and
speak the plainest English.” “Wakondah,” then, from
beginning to end, is trash. With the trivial exceptions
which we shall designate, it has <span class='it'>no</span> merit whatever; while
its faults, more numerous than the leaves of Valombrosa,
are of that rampant class which, if any schoolboy <span class='it'>could</span> be
found so uninformed as to commit them, any schoolboy
should be remorselessly flogged for committing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story, or as the epics have it, the argument, although
brief, is by no means particularly easy of comprehension.
The design seems to be based upon a passage in Mr. Irving’s
“Astoria.” He tells us that the Indians who inhabit the
Chippewyan range of mountains, call it the “Crest of the
World,” and “think that Wakondah, or the Master of Life,
as they designate the Supreme Being, has his residence
among these aerial heights.” Upon this hint Mr. Mathews has
proceeded. He introduces us to Wakondah standing in person
upon a mountain-top. He describes his appearance,
and thinks that a Chinook would be frightened to behold it.
He causes the “Master of Life” to make a speech, which
is addressed, generally, to things at large, and particularly
to the neighboring Woods, Cataracts, Rivers, Pinnacles,
Steeps, and Lakes—not to mention an Earthquake. But all
these (and we think, judiciously) turn a deaf ear to the
oration, which, to be plain, is scarcely equal to a second-rate
Piankitank stump speech. In fact, it is a bare-faced
attempt at animal magnetism, and the mountains, &amp;c., do
no more than show its potency in resigning themselves to
sleep, as they do.</p>

<p class='noindent'>—then he becomes <span class='it'>very</span> indignant, and accordingly launches
forth into speech the second—with which the delinquents
are afflicted, with occasional brief interruptions from the
poet, in proper person, until the conclusion of the poem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>subject</span> of the two orations we shall be permitted
to sum up compendiously in the one term “rigmarole.”
But we do not mean to say that our compendium is not an
improvement, and a very considerable one, upon the
speeches themselves,—which, taken altogether, are the
queerest, and the most rhetorical, not to say the most miscellaneous
orations we ever remember to have listened to
outside of an Arkansas House of Delegates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In saying this we mean what we say. We intend no
joke. Were it possible, we would quote the whole poem in
support of our opinion. But as this is <span class='it'>not</span> possible, and
moreover, as we presume Mr. Mathews has not been so
negligent as to omit securing his valuable property by a
copyright, we must be contented with a few extracts here
and there at random, with a few comments equally so. But
we have already hinted that there were really one or two
words to be said of this effusion in the way of commendation,
and these one or two words might as well be said now
as hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poem thus commences—</p>

<p class='line0'>The moon ascends the vaulted sky to-night;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With a slow motion full of pomp ascends,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But, mightier than the Moon that o’er it bends,</p>
<p class='line0'>A form is dwelling on the mountain height</p>
<p class='line0'>That boldly intercepts the struggling light</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With darkness nobler than the planet’s fire,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A gloom and dreadful grandeur that aspire</p>
<p class='line0'>To match the cheerful Heaven’s far-shining might.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>If we were to shut our eyes to the repetition of “might,”
(which, in its various inflections, is a pet word with our
author, and lugged in upon all occasions) and to the obvious
imitation of Longfellow’s Hymn to the Night in the second
line of this stanza, we should be justified in calling it <span class='it'>good</span>.
The “darkness nobler than the planet’s fire” is <span class='it'>certainly</span>
good. The general conception of the colossal figure on the
mountain summit, relieved against the full moon, would be
unquestionably <span class='it'>grand</span> were it not for the <span class='it'>bullish</span> phraseology
by which the conception is rendered, in a great measure,
abortive. The moon is described as “ascending,” and its
“motion” is referred to, while we have the standing figure
continuously intercepting its light. That the orb would soon
pass from behind the figure, is a physical fact which the
purpose of the poet required to be left out of sight, and
which scarcely any other language than that which he has
actually employed would have succeeded in forcing upon
the reader’s attention. With all these defects, however,
the passage, especially as an opening passage, is one of
high merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking carefully for something else to be commended

<p class='pindent'>This again, however, is worth only qualified commendation.
The first six lines preserve the personification (that
of a ship) sufficiently well; but, in the seventh and eighth,
the author suffers the image to slide into that of a warrior
unsheathing his sword. Still there is <span class='it'>force</span> in these concluding
verses, and we begin to fancy that this is saying a very
great deal for the author of “Puffer Hopkins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is, positively, not bad. The first line italicized is bold
and vigorous, both in thought and expression; and the four
last (although by no means original) convey a striking picture.
But then the whole idea, in its general want of keeping,
is preposterous. What is more absurd than the conception
of a man’s head descending <span class='it'>to his knees</span>, as here described—the
thing could not be done by an Indian juggler or a man
of gum-caoutchouc—and what is more inappropriate than
the resemblance attempted to be drawn between a <span class='it'>single</span>
head descending, and the <span class='it'>innumerable</span> pinnacles of a falling
city? It is difficult to understand, <span class='it'>en passant</span>, why Mr.
Mathews has thought proper to give “cathedrals” a quantity
which does not belong to it, or to write “unconjectured”
when the rhythm might have been fulfilled by “unexpected”
and when “unexpected” would have fully conveyed the
meaning which “unconjectured” does not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us endeavor to translate this gibberish, by way of
ascertaining its import, if possible. Or, rather, let us state
the stanzas, in substance. The spirit <span class='it'>lowers</span>, that is to say
<span class='it'>grows angry</span>, and speaks. He calls upon the Wild Woods
to tremble, and upon the Cataracts to sound their voices
which have the tone of an organ. He addresses, then, <span class='it'>an</span>
Earthquake, or perhaps Earthquake in general, and requests
it to <span class='it'>level flat</span> all the Deep Crags which are bound by massy
tenures in earth—a request, by the way, which any sensible
Earthquake must have regarded as tautological, since
it is difficult to level anything otherwise than <span class='it'>flat</span>:—Mr.
Mathews, however, is no doubt the best judge of flatness
in the abstract, and may have peculiar ideas respecting it.
But to proceed with the Spirit. Turning to the Winds, he
enjoins them to howl and break the peace that broods
above this world and steadfastly eludes their power—the
same peace that mocks a Dismay ’mid streams, rocks,
et cetera. He now speaks to the night-shadowed Rivers,
and commands them to lift their dusky hands, and clap
them harshly <span class='it'>with a sullen roar</span>—and as <span class='it'>roaring</span> with one’s
<span class='it'>hands</span> is not the easiest matter in the world, we can only
conclude that the Rivers here reluctantly disobeyed the
injunction. Nothing daunted, however, the Spirit, addressing
a thousand Pinnacles and Steeps, desires them to deplore
the glory that departs, or is departing—and we can
almost fancy that we see the Pinnacles deploring it upon
the spot. The Lakes—at least such of them as possess
azure waves and snowy strands—then come in for their
share of the oration. They are called upon to observe—to
take notice—that above them stands no ordinary character—no
Piankitank stump orator, or anything of that sort—but
a Power;—a power, in short, to use the exact words of
Mr. Mathews, “that <span class='it'>utters forth</span> his loud behest, till
mountain, lake and river shall attest the puissance of a
Master’s <span class='it'>large commands</span>.” <span class='it'>Utters forth</span> is no doubt somewhat
supererogatory, since “to utter” is of itself to emit,
or send forth; but as “the Power” appears to be somewhat
excited he should be forgiven such mere errors of speech.
We cannot, however, pass over his boast about uttering
forth his loud behest <span class='it'>till</span> mountain, lake and rivers shall
obey him—for the fact is that his threat is <span class='it'>vox et preterea
nihil</span>, like the countryman’s nightingale in Catullus; the
issue showing that the mountains, lakes and rivers—all
very sensible creatures—go fast asleep upon the spot, and
pay no attention to his rigmarole whatever. Upon the
“large commands” it is not our intention to dwell. The
phrase is a singularly mercantile one to be in the mouth of
“a Power.” It is not impossible, however, that Mr. Mathews
himself is</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>But to resume. We were originally told that the Spirit
“lowered” and spoke, and in truth his entire speech is a
scold at Creation; yet stanza the eighth is so forgetful as to
say that he spoke “with a wide-cast look of bounteous
power and <span class='it'>cheerful</span> majesty.” Be this point as it may, he
now shakes his brandished arms, and, swelling out, seems
to grow⁠—</p>

<p class='noindent'>—or as swells a turkey-gobbler; whose image the poet unquestionably

not say <span class='it'>tuk</span> at once? We have heard of chaps vot

<p class='pindent'>We shall never get on. Stanza the ninth assures us that
the woods are deaf and will not be aroused, that the mountains
are asleep and so forth—all which Mr. Mathews
might have anticipated. But the rest he could not have
foreseen. He could not have foreknown that “the rivers,
housed beneath their banks in <span class='it'>darksome stillness</span>,” would
“loiter like a calm-bound sea,” and still less could he have
been aware, unless informed of the fact, that “<span class='it'>cliff, wilderness

<p class='noindent'>Between the two, Mr. Mathews’ claim to originality, at
this point, will, very possibly, fall to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears to us that the author of “Wakondah” is either
very innocent or very original about matters of versification.
His stanza is an ordinary one. If we are not mistaken,
it is that employed by Campbell in his “Gertrude of
Wyoming”—a favorite poem of our author’s. At all events
it is composed of pentameters whose rhymes alternate by a
simple and fixed rule. But our poet’s deviations from this
rule are so many and so unusually picturesque, that we
scarcely know what to think of them. Sometimes he introduces
an Alexandrine at the close of a stanza; and here we
have no right to quarrel with him. It is not <span class='it'>usual</span> in this
metre; but still he <span class='it'>may</span> do it if he pleases. To put an
Alexandrine in the middle, or at the beginning, of one of
these stanzas is droll, to say no more. See stanza third,
which commences with the verse</p>

<p class='noindent'>Here it must be observed that “wild woods” is not meant
for a double rhyme. If scanned on the fingers (and we
presume Mr. Mathews is in the practice of scanning thus)
the line is a legitimate Alexandrine. Nevertheless, it cannot
be <span class='it'>read</span>. It is like nothing under the sun; except, perhaps,
Sir Philip Sidney’s attempt at English Hexameter in
his “Arcadia.” Some one or two of his verses we remember.

<p class='pindent'>But these are trifles. Mr. Mathews is young and we take
it for granted that he will improve. In the meantime what
does he mean by spelling lose, <span class='it'>loose</span>, and its (the possessive
pronoun) <span class='it'>it’s</span>—re-iterated instances of which fashions are to
be found <span class='it'>passim</span> in “Wakondah”? What does he mean by
writing <span class='it'>dare</span>, the present, for <span class='it'>dared</span> the perfect?—see stanza

<p class='pindent'>Is not this something like “blacker than a dozen and a
half of chimney-sweeps and a stack of black cats,” and are
not the whole of these illustrative observations of yours
somewhat upon the plan of that of the witness who described
a certain article stolen as being of the size and
shape of a bit of chalk? What do you <span class='it'>mean</span> by them we say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here notwithstanding our earnest wish to satisfy the
author of Wakondah, it is indispensable that we bring our
notice of the poem to a close. We feel grieved that our
observations have been so much at random:—but at random,
after all, is it alone possible to convey either the letter or
the spirit of that, which, a mere jumble of incongruous
nonsense, has neither beginning, middle, nor end. We
should be delighted to proceed—but how? to applaud—but
what? Surely not this trumpery declamation, this maudlin
sentiment, this metaphor run-mad, this twaddling verbiage,
this halting and doggerel rhythm, this unintelligible rant and
cant! “Slid, if these be your passados and montantes,
we’ll have none of them.” Mr. Mathews, you have clearly
mistaken your vocation, and your effusion as little deserves
the title of <span class='it'>poem</span>, (oh sacred name!) as did the rocks of the
royal forest of Fontainebleau that of “<span class='it'>mes déserts</span>” bestowed
upon them by Francis the First. In bidding you adieu we

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
